- en: This section will help you get started with type inferencing, which was one
    of the main features of Java 10\. We will then learn about application class data
    sharing, which helps in selecting application classes in the shared archived files.
    Moving on, we will explore more about the GC interface and parallel full GC for
    G1\. Lastly, we will cover the remaining additions or updates to Java 10, most
    of which are related to changes in the JDK or its implementation.
