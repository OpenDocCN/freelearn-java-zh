- en: In the last chapter, we built our application layer and interacted with it via
    the REPL. This works sufficiently well for a single user performing ad hoc interactions,
    but it does not scale. Indeed, we could imagine a scenario where a third party
    or even another of our own services wants to make use of the data stored in our
    database, perform calculations, and persist updates. This interaction would be
    programmatic and would, therefore, benefit from being exposed over **HyperText
    Transfer Protocol** (**HTTP**) or similar.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We can achieve this by exposing our application layer via a web service. A web
    service allows interaction with our application layer over a network (most typically
    the internet, although it could be over an intranet for private applications).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To build our web service, we'll need a web application library to build our
    API, a web server to serve it up over HTTP, and a routing library to route incoming
    requests to the appropriate handler. Clojure has numerous implementations of each;
    however, for this chapter, we'll focus on using `Compojure` for routing, and Jetty
    to serve it all up.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Before we dive into building a web service, let's cover the basics. HTTP is
    one of the primary protocols for communicating across the internet, particularly
    when working in a web browser. This protocol provides a contract for a client
    (typically a web browser) to communicate with a (web) server. In this example,
    the browser will construct a request containing a Uniform Resource Identifier
    (URI), which it will use to communicate to the server. The server will interpret
    the request, using the URI string to determine which resource the client is interested
    in retrieving/manipulating, then constructing a response containing information
    indicating that the request has completed, or containing a payload in the form
    of the response body.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Typically, when building a web service, we want to conform to the **REpresentational
    State Transfer** (**REST**) architecture. This architecture prescribes a set of
    operations we can choose to perform against a resource, allowing us to transition
    that resource through a number of valid states.

    that we wish to read the content associated with the resource in the URI provided.
    The PUT method has an associated body containing the updated address; we're instructing
    the server to create/update the address resource with that provided.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: An important distinction to make between PUT and POST is that PUT should be
    used when updating an existing resource or when we happen to know the unique ID
    of the entity we're creating. POST is used solely for the creation of resources
    and does not require us to know its unique ID. Instead, this ID will be allocated
    by the web service itself and communicated back to the client via the response
    headers.

    an incoming request represented as a map, perform some operations based on the
    content of that map (for example, fetch a user's profile or update their address),
    and produce an appropriate response map ready to be rendered by a browser or interpreted
    by the client more generally. In Ring, the function that performs this conversion

    each of our routes and encode the response before we return it. While this would
    work, it would introduce a great deal of duplicative code into our application
    and distract from the core work of the route itself.  For example, we may have
    a `render-response` function that determines which format to render based on the
    `accept` header. We would be obligated to include this call in every one of our
    routes. Much more preferable would be the ability to define this once and have

- en: The application layer delivered as part of `packt-clj.tennis` from *Chapter
    13*, *Database Interaction and the Application Layer*, has been well received.
    You have now been asked to make this more widely available via a REST web service.
    Of most interest is the ability to browse player data, tennis matches, and ELO
    changes over time. The ability to persist new tennis matches and recalculate the
    ELO has also been requested. The historic data should be assumed to be already
    available in our database.

    you'd like to expose, then build your web service to expose those resources via

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This chapter introduced us to HTTP, web servers, and the request-response interaction
    between a web server and a client. Multiple clients were introduced, including
    the most typical (the web browser) as well as `curl` and `clj-http`. We learned
    how a web server takes an incoming request and routes it according to key elements
    of the incoming request map, before constructing a response map, which is then
    presented to the requesting client.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We learned about middleware and how it intercepts our request and/or response
    map. We then used `muuntaja` to format the content we generated for the client,
    as well as to format incoming data from the client as JSON or EDN.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: After considering the content of our database in the context of groups of related
    resources, we learned how to construct appropriate paths to address them using
    a REST architecture. This paved the way for integrating our existing application
    layers with a web service that would allow any web client to interact with them
    over HTTP.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We can now imagine a frontend (user interface) pulling resources from our web
    service, formatting them, and presenting them to a user who is then capable of
    manipulating those resources. In this case, the IDs (which are not particularly
    user-friendly) could be tracked by the UI and kept hidden from the users.
