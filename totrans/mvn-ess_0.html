Maven stands out among other build tools due to its extremely extensible architecture, which is built on top of the concept convention over configuration. This, in fact, has made Maven the de-facto tool to manage and build Java projects. It's being used widely by many open source Java projects under the Apache Software Foundation, SourceForge, Google Code, and many more.</p><p>This book provides a step-by-step guide, showing the readers how to use Apache Maven in an optimal way to address enterprise build requirements. Following the book, readers will be able to gain a thorough understanding of the following key areas:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">How to get started with Apache Maven, applying Maven best practices in order to design a build system to improve a developer's productivity</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">How to customize the build process to suit it exactly to your enterprise's needs by using appropriate Maven plugins, lifecycles, and archetypes</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">How to troubleshoot build issues with greater confidence</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">How to design the build in a way that avoids any maintenance nightmares with proper dependency management</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">How to optimize Maven configuration settings</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">How to build your own distribution archive using Maven assemblies</li></ul></div><div class="section" title="What this book covers"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl1sec02"/>What this book covers</h1></div></div></div><p>
<a class="link" href="ch01.html" title="Chapter 1. Apache Maven Quick Start">Chapter 1</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Apache Maven Quick Start</em></span>, focuses on building a basic foundation around Maven to get started. It starts by explaining the basic steps to install and configure Maven on Ubuntu, Mac OS X, and Microsoft Windows operating systems. The latter part of the chapter covers some of the common useful Maven tips and tricks.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch02.html" title="Chapter 2. Understanding the Project Object Model (POM)">Chapter 2</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Understanding the Project Object Model (POM)</em></span>, focuses on the Maven Project Object Model (POM) and how to adhere to the industry-wide accepted best practices to avoid maintenance nightmares. The key elements of a POM file, POM hierarchy and inheritance, managing dependencies, and related topics are covered here.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch03.html" title="Chapter 3. Maven Archetypes">Chapter 3</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Maven Archetypes</em></span>, focuses on how Maven archetypes provide a way of reducing repetitive work in building Maven projects. There are thousands of archetypes out there that are available publicly to help you build different types of projects. This chapter covers a commonly used set of archetypes.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch04.html" title="Chapter 4. Maven Plugins">Chapter 4</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Maven Plugins</em></span>, covers some of the most commonly used Maven plugins and then explains how plugins are discovered and executed. Maven only provides a build framework, while the Maven plugins perform the actual tasks. Maven has a large, rich set of plugins, and the chances are very small that you will have to write your own custom plugin.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch05.html" title="Chapter 5. Build Lifecycles">Chapter 5</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Build Lifecycles</em></span>, explains how the three standard lifecycles work and how we can customize them. Later in the chapter, we discuss how to develop our own lifecycle extensions.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch06.html" title="Chapter 6. Maven Assemblies">Chapter 6</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Maven Assemblies</em></span>, covers real-world examples of how to use the Maven assembly plugin in detail, and finally concludes with an end-to-end sample Maven project.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch07.html" title="Chapter 7. Best Practices">Chapter 7</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Best Practices</em></span>, looks at and highlights some of the best practices to be followed in a large-scale development project with Maven. It is always recommended to follow the best practices since it will drastically improve developer productivity and reduce any maintenance nightmares.</p></div></div>
