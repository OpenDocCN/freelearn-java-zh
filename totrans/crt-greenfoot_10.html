You may grow old and trembling in your anatomies, you may lie awake at night listening to the disorder of your veins, you may miss your only love, you may see the world about you devastated by evil lunatics, or know your honour trampled in the sewers of baser minds. There is only one thing for it then—to learn. Learn why the world wags and what wags it. That is the only thing which the mind can never exhaust, never alienate, never be tortured by, never fear or distrust, and never dream of regretting. Learning is the only thing for you.

We have covered numerous solutions to common problems encountered in writing and developing interactive programs. Writing interactive programs requires not only technical expertise, but also a clear understanding of how to engage and entertain users. We also covered software design, code organization, debugging, and an accepted process for software development for an object-oriented language. These skills will transfer to future programming projects, even if you end up coding in a different programming language.</p><p>In this book, we covered the following topics:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem">Animation</li><li class="listitem">Collision detection</li><li class="listitem">Projectiles</li><li class="listitem">Interactive application design and theory</li><li class="listitem">Scrolling and mapped worlds</li><li class="listitem">Artificial Intelligence</li><li class="listitem">User interfaces</li><li class="listitem">Gamepads</li></ul></div><p>Regardless of your background when you started reading this book, you now have an impressive array of creative skills. <span class="emphasis"><em>Let's not waste them!</em></span> Moving forward, I would like to challenge you to exercise and improve your skills. In this chapter, we will explore courses of action to do just that.</p><div class="section" title="Build something larger"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch10lvl1sec57"/>Build something larger</h1></div></div></div><p>While we have built<a id="id607" class="indexterm"/> programs of some size, we have kept the scope of the work small for pedagogical and practical reasons. However, you have the skills to create large, complex forms of entertainment. Brainstorm a project for yourself that you feel could keep someone engaged, via learning or playing, for over an hour. Spend a considerable amount of time on the design, story, and content of your project. Before coding, create a storyboard that will serve as an outline of your project and as the initial artifact that you can show users (or players) to get some early feedback.</p><div class="note" title="Note"><h3 class="title"><a id="note28"/>Note</h3><p><span class="strong"><strong>Storyboards</strong></span></p><p>Storyboards<a id="id608" class="indexterm"/> are an efficient way to explore the design of a movie, play, book, or any form of interactive entertainment. For games, they are especially useful. In simple terms, a storyboard is very similar to creating a comic book of the story you are telling. With storyboards, the individual panes of the comic book are put on separate pieces of paper, making it easy to rearrange their order or insert/delete specific scenes.</p><p>Storyboards provide a medium to quickly understand the sequence, content, and flow of a piece of work. As they can be easily pinned on a wall for easy viewing, they also work well in aiding collaborations between writers, programmers, musicians, and artists. Disney was the first company to use them in their process (1930s) to create animated stories.</p></div><p>You need to go back and review <a class="link" title="Chapter 5. Interactive Application Design and Theory" href="part0034.xhtml">Chapter 5</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Interactive Application Design and Theory</em></span>, and follow the ideas and processes discussed there to carefully grow your project in a way that will engage users/players. Remember that a project like this requires you to expand the project over time through user/player feedback.</p><p>Do you have any artistic skill or know a friend or two good at creating digital art? Enlist their help and really give your project a polished and professional look. Pay attention to all of the details and enhance all aspects of your project to improve the overall experience. Are you a <a id="id609" class="indexterm"/>musician or know one? Adding original musical scores and sound effects to your project can really elevate its impact.</p></div></div>
<div class="section" title="Share your work"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch10lvl1sec58"/>Share your work</h1></div></div></div><p>Greenfoot <a id="id610" class="indexterm"/>provides you with several ways in which you can share your work with others. A music teacher will often arrange recitals for his/her students, giving them true motivation for improvement. In the same way, you should always plan to share your work with a wider audience. Knowing that your work will be on display gives you extra incentive to be thorough and detailed in your work. More importantly, sharing your work provides the opportunity to collect valuable feedback from players, programmers, and game designers. Feedback from this audience is crucial to perfecting your skills.</p><div class="section" title="Publishing on Greenfoot.org"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch10lvl2sec83"/>Publishing on Greenfoot.org</h2></div></div></div><p>Greenfoot allows <a id="id611" class="indexterm"/>you to easily and immediately share your Greenfoot scenarios online. In the upper-right corner of your scenario window, you will see the <span class="strong"><strong>Share…</strong></span> button. This button will allow you to share your scenario directly on Greenfoot's online gallery. Through the gallery, anyone on the Internet will be able to access, play, download, and make comments on your work. The Greenfoot online community is large and very supportive and can provide you with a wealth of feedback and information. To share your work, perform the following steps:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic"><li class="listitem">Click on the <span class="strong"><strong>Share</strong></span> button.</li><li class="listitem">Click on the <span class="strong"><strong>Publish</strong></span> tab.</li><li class="listitem">Fill out the form shown in <span class="emphasis"><em>Figure 1</em></span>.</li><li class="listitem">Click on <span class="strong"><strong>Submit</strong></span>.</li></ol><div style="height:10px; width: 1px"/></div><p>If everything went well, your project will open up in your web browser.

<div class="section" title="Summary"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch10lvl1sec61"/>Summary</h1></div></div></div><p>In writing this book, I have tried to imagine your desire to be creative, your troubles, and your successes as you worked your way through this book. I wanted to provide you with a path that challenged you, yet did not overburden you with facts and information tangential to the task at hand. And now, I realize I am going to miss having this discussion with you. I hope you have found some worth in this book and that you are inspired to create. This is the end of our discussion, but just the beginning of your creative journey with Greenfoot.</p></div></body></html>
