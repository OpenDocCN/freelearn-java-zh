- en: Scala is a fantastic language that provides a great combination between functional
    and object-oriented programming. With Scala, you're able to write beautiful, concise,
    and easily maintainable code in a highly productive manner. Scala also provides
    very useful language constructs for creating REST services. In the Scala ecosystem,
    there is a large number of REST frameworks and each one of them allows you to
    create such services in a slightly different manner. This book gives you an overview
    of five of the most mature and flexible REST frameworks available, and shows you,
    through extensive examples, how you can use the various features of these frameworks.
