- en: This book is about Java 9 which is one of the most popular application development
    languages. The latest released version Java 9 comes with a host of new features
    and new APIs with lots of ready to use components to build efficient and scalable
    applications. Streams, parallel and asynchronous processing, multithreading, JSON
    support, reactive programming, and microservices comprise the hallmark of modern
    programming and are now fully integrated into the JDK.

    *Multithreading and Reactive Programming*, shows how to monitor Java applications
    programmatically using command-line tools. You will also explore how to improve
    the application performance via multithreading and how to tune the JVM itself
    after learning about the bottlenecks through monitoring.'

    the solution many leaders of the industry have adopted while addressing flexible
    scaling under the load. It talks about adding more workers by splitting the application
    into several microservices, each deployed independently and each using multiple
    threads and reactive programming for better performance, response, scalability,
    and fault-tolerance.'

    *Making Use of New APIs to Improve Your Code*, describes improvements in the programming
    tools, including stream filters, a stack-walking API, the new convenient static
    factory methods for creating immutable collections, a new powerful CompletableFuture
    class in support of asynchronous processing, and the JDK 9 stream API improvements.'
