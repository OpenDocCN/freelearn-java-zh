			<p class="author-quote">“A spoon does not know the taste of soup, nor a learned fool the taste of wisdom.” </p>
			<p class="author-quote">– Welsh proverb </p>
			<p>In this chapter, we will introduce a fictitious organization named <strong class="bold">Kosmo Prima</strong> (<strong class="bold">KP</strong>) Bank that is looking to modernize its product offerings in the international trade business. In order to establish a business strategy that sets it up for sustained success in the medium to long term, we will employ a series of techniques and practices to help expedite its path from strategy to execution.</p>
			<p>At the outset, let’s gain a high-level understanding of KP Bank’s business domain before we dive deeper.</p>
			<p>In this chapter, we will cover the following topics:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>The domain of international trade</li>
				<li>International trade at KP Bank</li>
				<li>Understanding international trade strategy at KP Bank</li>
				<li>International trade products and services</li>
			</ul>
			<p>At the end of this chapter, you will gain an appreciation of how to employ techniques such as the business value canvas and the lean canvas to establish a sound understanding of business strategy. Furthermore, we will examine how plotting an impact map will allow us to correlate business deliverables to goals. Finally, the Wardley mapping exercise will establish the importance of our business decisions in relation to our competitive landscape.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-56"><a id="_idTextAnchor055"/>The domain of international trade</h1>
			<p>In many countries, international<a id="_idIndexMarker217"/> trade represents a significant <a id="_idIndexMarker218"/>portion of the <strong class="bold">gross domestic product</strong> (<strong class="bold">GDP</strong>), making <a id="_idIndexMarker219"/>an exchange of capital, goods, and services between untrusted parties spread across the globe a necessity. While economic organizations such as <a id="_idIndexMarker220"/>the <strong class="bold">World Trade Organization</strong> (<strong class="bold">WTO</strong>) were formed specifically to<a id="_idIndexMarker221"/> ease and facilitate this process, differences in factors such as economic policy, trade laws, and currency ensure that carrying out trade internationally can be a complex process, with several entities involved across countries. A letter of credit exists to simplify this process. Let’s take a look at how it works.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-57"><a id="_idTextAnchor056"/>International trade at KP Bank</h1>
			<p>KP Bank has <a id="_idIndexMarker222"/>been in business for several years and has been focusing on providing a variety of banking solutions, such as retail, corporate, securities, and other products. They have been steadily expanding operations to other countries and continents. This has allowed them to expand their international trade business significantly in the last decade. While they have been among the leaders in this space, the recent onset of new digital-native competitors has started to eat into their business and impact their top line adversely. Customers are complaining that the process is too cumbersome, time-consuming, and lately unreliable. In addition, due to a very inefficient manual process that is currently in place, KP Bank has been finding it very hard to keep a check on costs. In just the last 3 years, they have had to increase transaction processing costs by around 50 percent! Not surprisingly, this has coincided with plummeting customer satisfaction,  which is evidenced by the fact that the number of customers serviced has remained flat over the intervening time.</p>
			<p>The CIO has recognized that there is a need to look at this problem afresh and come up with a strategy that sets KP Bank up for sustained success for the next few years and reestablish them as one of the leaders in the international trade business.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-58"><a id="_idTextAnchor057"/>Understanding international trade strategy at KP Bank</h1>
			<p>To arrive at an optimal solution, it is important to have a strong appreciation of the company’s business goals and their alignment to support the needs of the users of the solution. We will introduce a set of tools and techniques we have found to be useful.</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Note</p>
			<p class="callout">It is pertinent to note that these tools were conceived independently, but when practiced in conjunction with other DDD techniques, they can accentuate the effectiveness of the overall process and solution. The use of these tools should be considered complementary to your DDD journey.</p>
			<p>Let’s look at some<a id="_idIndexMarker223"/> of the most popular techniques we have employed to quickly gain an understanding of the business problem and propose solutions.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-59"><a id="_idTextAnchor058"/>The business model canvas</h2>
			<p>As we <a id="_idIndexMarker224"/>have mentioned several times, it is important <a id="_idIndexMarker225"/>to make sure that we are solving the right problem before attempting to solve it. The business model canvas, originally conceived by Swiss consultant Alexander Osterwalder as part of his PhD thesis, is a quick and easy way to establish that we are solving a valuable problem in a single visual that captures nine<a id="_idIndexMarker226"/> elements of your business:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Value propositions</strong>: What do you do?</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Key activities</strong>: How do you do it?</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Key resources</strong>: What do you need?</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Key partners</strong>: Who will help you?</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Cost structure</strong>: What will it cost?</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Revenue streams</strong>: How much will you make?</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Customer segments</strong>: Who are you creating value for?</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Customer relationships</strong>: Who do you interact with?</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Channels</strong>: How do you reach your customers?</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The business model canvas helps establish a shared understanding of the big picture among a varied set of groups, including business stakeholders, domain experts, product owners, architects, and developers. We have found it very useful when embarking on both greenfield and brownfield engagements. Here is an attempt we made to create a business model canvas<a id="_idIndexMarker227"/> for the international trade business at KP Bank:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer058" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B16716_Figure_3.1_NEW.jpg" alt="Figure 3.1 – A business model canvas&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 3.1 – A business model canvas</p>
			<p>Using this<a id="_idIndexMarker228"/> canvas leads to insights about the customers we intend to serve at the bank, what value propositions are offered through what channels, and how we make money. When developing a business model canvas, it is recommended that we follow the numbered sequence depicted in the previous figure in order to gain a better understanding of the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>The desirability of the business (who our customers are and what they want)</li>
				<li>The feasibility of the business (how we can operationalize and deliver it)</li>
				<li>The economic viability of the business (how we can identify costs and capture profits)</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Creating a business model canvas can prove challenging if you do not have an existing product already, which is usually true in the case of start-ups or existing enterprises expanding into <a id="_idIndexMarker229"/>new business areas. In such cases, a variation in the form of the lean canvas is worth exploring.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-60"><a id="_idTextAnchor059"/>The lean canvas</h2>
			<p>A variation<a id="_idIndexMarker230"/> of the business model canvas called<a id="_idIndexMarker231"/> the <strong class="bold">lean canvas</strong> was conceived by Ash Maurya for lean startups. In contrast to the business model canvas, the main emphasis here is to first and foremost elaborate on the problem that needs to be solved and explore potential solutions. In order to make the canvas actionable, the idea is to capture items that were most uncertain and/or risky. This is pertinent for businesses operating under high uncertainty (which is usually true for start-ups). Similar to DDD, it encourages you to focus on an issue as the starting point for building a business.</p>
			<p>Structurally, it is similar to the <a id="_idIndexMarker232"/>business model canvas, with the following differences:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Problems</strong> instead of <em class="italic">key partners</em>: It is common for businesses to fail due to them misunderstanding the problem they are solving. The rationale for replacing the <strong class="bold">key partners</strong> block is that when you are an unknown entity looking to establish an unproven product, pursuing key partnerships may be premature.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Solutions</strong> instead of <em class="italic">key activities</em>: It is important to try more than one solution iteratively and respond to feedback. <strong class="bold">Key activities</strong> are removed because they are usually a by-product of the solution.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Key metrics</strong> instead of <em class="italic">key resources</em>: It is very important to know that we are progressing in the right direction. It is advisable to focus on a small number of <strong class="bold">key metrics</strong> to enable pivoting quickly if needed. <strong class="bold">Key resources</strong> have become relatively easy (with the advent of the cloud and the availability of mature frameworks). Furthermore, they may appear in the <strong class="bold">Unfair advantage</strong> box, which we will discuss next.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Unfair advantage</strong> instead of <em class="italic">customer relationships</em>: This clearly establishes our differentiators that are hard to replicate. This is closely aligned to the idea of the core subdomain<a id="_idIndexMarker233"/> that we discussed in <a href="B16716_01_Final_NM_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor015"><em class="italic">Chapter 1</em></a>, <em class="italic">The Rationale for Domain-Driven Design</em>, and gives us a clear picture of what we need to focus our energies on at the outset.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The result of a <a id="_idIndexMarker234"/>lean canvas workshop we ran for KP Bank is shown here:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer059" class="IMG---Figure">

				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 3.2 – A lean canvas for the international trade business</p>
			<p>The exact sequence <a id="_idIndexMarker235"/>in which to fill out the lean canvas may vary. On his blog, Ash Maurya suggests that there may not be a<a id="_idIndexMarker236"/> prescriptive running order to do this exercise (<a href="https://blog.leanstack.com/what-is-the-right-fill-order-for-a-lean-canvas/">https://blog.leanstack.com/what-is-the-right-fill-order-for-a-lean-canvas/</a>). Personally, we like starting by elaborating on the problem before moving on to other aspects of the canvas. Both the business model canvas and the lean canvas provide a high-level view of the business model, the high-priority problems, and the potential solutions. Next, let’s look at impact mapping, another lightweight planning technique to arrive at an outcome-driven plan, based on mind maps.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-61"><a id="_idTextAnchor060"/>Impact maps</h2>
			<p>An<a id="_idIndexMarker237"/> impact map is a visualization and strategic <a id="_idIndexMarker238"/>planning tool that enables you to understand scope and underlying assumptions. It was created collaboratively by senior technical and business people in the form of a mind map by considering the following four aspects:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Goals</strong>: <em class="italic">Why</em> are we doing this?</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Actors</strong>: <em class="italic">Who</em> are the consumers or users of our product? In other words, who will be impacted by it?</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Impacts</strong>: <em class="italic">How</em> can the consumers’ change in behavior help us achieve our goals – in other words, the impacts that we’re trying to create?</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Deliverables</strong>: <em class="italic">What</em> can we do, as an organization or a delivery team, to support the required impacts – in other words, the software features or process changes that are required to be realized as part of the solution?</li>
			</ul>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer060" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B16716_Figure_3.3.jpg" alt="Figure 3.3 – A simple impact map&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 3.3 – A simple impact map</p>
			<p>Impact mapping<a id="_idIndexMarker239"/> provides an easy-to-understand <a id="_idIndexMarker240"/>visual representation of the relationship between the goals, users, and impacts on the deliverables. Next, let us examine Wardley maps that enable us to dive deeper, understand our purpose, and determine which portions of the business provide the most value.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-62"><a id="_idTextAnchor061"/>Wardley maps</h2>
			<p>The<a id="_idIndexMarker241"/> business <a id="_idIndexMarker242"/>model canvas and lean canvas can help establish clarity of purpose at a high level. The Wardley map is another tool to help build a business strategy and establish purpose. It provides a sketch of the people that a system is built for, followed by the benefits the system offers them, and a chain of needs required to provide those benefits (called the <strong class="bold">value chain</strong>). Next, the <a id="_idIndexMarker243"/>value chain is plotted along an evolution axis, which ranges from something that is uncharted <a id="_idIndexMarker244"/>and uncertain<a id="_idIndexMarker245"/> to something that is highly standardized. Building a Wardley map can be done in <a id="_idIndexMarker246"/>six steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1"><strong class="bold">Purpose</strong>: What is your purpose? Why does the organization or project exist?</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Scope</strong>: What is (and not) included within the scope of the map?</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Users</strong>: Who uses or interacts with the thing you are mapping?</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">User needs</strong>: What do your users need from the thing you are mapping?</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Value chain</strong>: What do we need to be doing to fulfill those needs captured previously? These needs are arranged according to their dependencies, resulting in the creation of a value chain that maps user needs to a series of activities in the order of their visibility to the user (going from most visible to the least).</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Map</strong>: Finally, plot the map using the evolutionary characteristics to decide where to place each component along the horizontal axis.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>We conducted a <a id="_idIndexMarker247"/>Wardley mapping exercise at KP Bank for their international trade business, as shown here:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer061" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B16716_Figure_3.4.jpg" alt="Figure 3.4 – A Wardley map for the international trade business at KP Bank&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 3.4 – A Wardley map for the international trade business at KP Bank</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Note</p>
			<p class="callout">On this canvas, we have chosen to elaborate on the needs of only one class of users (importers and exporters) for brevity. In a real-world scenario, we would have to repeat <em class="italic">steps 4, 5, and 6</em> for all types of users.</p>
			<p>The <a id="_idIndexMarker248"/>Wardley map <a id="_idIndexMarker249"/>makes it easy to understand the capabilities provided by our solution, their dependencies, and how value is derived. It also helps depict how these capabilities play out compared to those offered by competitors, allowing you to prioritize attention appropriately and make build versus buy decisions.</p>
			<p>We have <a id="_idIndexMarker250"/>examined several lightweight and collaborative techniques to quickly understand the problem space and the impacts we can <a id="_idIndexMarker251"/>have on our users and our business. Each of these techniques is fairly lightweight and can be completed within a matter of a few hours. Each enables us to focus on the most impactful business areas and maximize ROI. In our experience, it is worth experimenting with more than one of these exercises (potentially all of them) as each can highlight a different facet of the business/user needs.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-63"><a id="_idTextAnchor062"/>International trade products and services</h1>
			<p>International trade <a id="_idIndexMarker252"/>is fraught with risk, which then presents a degree of uncertainty over the timing of payments between the seller (exporter) and the buyer (importer), especially due to a lack of trust between the parties involved. For exporters, until payment is received, all sales are gifts. Consequently, exporters prefer receiving payment as soon as the order is placed or at least before the goods are shipped. For importers, until the goods are received, all payments made toward a purchase are donations. Consequently, importers prefer receiving goods as soon as possible and delaying payment until the goods are resold to generate enough money to pay the seller.</p>
			<p>This situation presents an opportunity for trusted intermediaries (such as KP Bank) to play a significant role in brokering international trade transactions in a secure manner. KP bank offers a <a id="_idIndexMarker253"/>number <a id="_idIndexMarker254"/>of products to facilitate international trade payments, as listed here:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Letter of credit (LC)</li>
				<li>Documentary collections (DC)</li>
				<li>Open account</li>
				<li>Cash-in-advance</li>
				<li>Consignments</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The following diagram shows the risk profile of each of these payment methods from both an exporter’s and importer’s perspective:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer062" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B16716_Figure_3.5.jpg" alt="Figure 3.5 – The risk profile of international trade payment methods&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 3.5 – The risk profile of international trade payment methods</p>
			<p>As is evident<a id="_idIndexMarker255"/> here, the DC and LC products offer a good balance in providing solutions that are relatively secure from the perspective of both parties. The involvement of a trusted intermediary such as KP Bank is required to play a part in the fulfillment process makes these payment methods less risky for both parties. From the bank’s perspective, streamlining the process for these products as a priority also provides a greater business opportunity compared to the other products. Of the two, the LC product satisfies most criteria, outlined against user needs in the recently concluded business strategy sessions we elaborated on earlier. Hence, the stakeholders at KP Bank have decided to move forward with heavy investment in the LC product at the outset.</p>
			<p>In the next chapter, and indeed the rest of the book, we will elaborate on how we can improve the LC application, issuance, and related processes by making use of tenets that align closely with the tenets of DDD.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-64"><a id="_idTextAnchor063"/>Summary</h1>
			<p>In this chapter, we have explored a variety of techniques that help establish whether a particular problem is the right one to be solved. Specifically, we looked at the business value canvas and the lean canvas to clarify the business strategy for both start-ups and established enterprises. We then looked at impact maps that enable you to unambiguously correlate business goals to user impacts and the deliverables needed to create those impacts. Finally, we looked at Wardley maps to further drill down areas that are important to focus energies on, including establishing build versus buy decisions, the importance of business strategy in relation to competitors, and the relative risk involved when heading into uncharted waters.</p>
			<p>In the next chapter, we will look at techniques and practices to drill down further and gain an understanding of the LC business so that we can start crafting domain model(s) to enable us to arrive at an appropriate solution.</p>
