- en: Java has been around for years, and if you count them all, you should get the
    number—20-plus years. This does not mean that Java is obsolete or dead; rather,
    Java is more than lively, and the new Java 8 language specification is the proof.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Because Java is not dead, WildFly wants to give you more power than ever. Thanks
    to its small memory footprint, WildFly can run in your pocket using the Raspberry
    Pi, it can be spread on Linux containers using Docker (the basis of microservice
    architectures), or it can hit the cloud using the OpenShift Online platform.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Furthermore, WildFly's new, modular nature lets you customize its system as
    needed. You can extend WildFly by providing your own extensions and subsystems.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: WildFly's modular class loading gives you fine-grained control over the libraries
    and Java classes an application requires to load, which allows you to have the
    proper traction to use WildFly in your continuous integration and continuous delivery
    practices.

- en: Moreover, WildFly provides a set of management APIs that can be used to manage
    the overall platform. You can interact with WildFly through the command-line interface
    (CLI), which is a powerful tool to manage the whole system. If you feel more comfortable
    with a UI, you can rely on the well-designed Web Console.

- en: One more reason to choose WildFly is its vibrant community and the whole Java
    EE environment. Don't forget that WildFly is the only open source Java EE 7 application
    server supported by its community!
