- en: Since 2011, Kafka's been exploding in terms of growth. More than one third of
    Fortune 500 companies use Apache Kafka. These companies include travel companies,
    banks, insurance companies, and telecom companies.

    their messages with Apache Kafka every day.

- en: Today, Apache Kafka is used to collect data, do real-time data analysis, and
    perform real-time data streaming. Kafka is also used to feed events to **Complex
    Event Processing** (**CEP**) architectures, is deployed in microservice architectures,
    and is implemented in **Internet of Things** (**IoT**) systems.

- en: 'In the realm of streaming, there are several competitors to Kafka Streams,
    including Apache Spark, Apache Flink, Akka Streams, Apache Pulsar, and Apache
    Beam. They are all in competition to perform better than Kafka. However, Apache
    Kafka has one key advantage over them all: its ease of use. Kafka is easy to implement
    and maintain, and its learning curve is not very steep.'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This book is a practical quick start guide. It is focused on showing practical
    examples and does not get involved in theoretical explanations or discussions
    of Kafka's architecture. This book is a compendium of hands-on recipes, solutions
    to everyday problems faced by those implementing Apache Kafka.
