			<p class="author-quote">“He who asks a question remains a fool for 5 minutes. He who does not ask remains a fool forever.”</p>
			<p class="author-quote">– Chinese proverb</p>
			<p>As we saw in the previous chapter, misinterpreted requirements can cause a significant portion of software projects to fail. Arriving at a shared understanding and creating a useful domain model requires high degrees of collaboration between domain experts. In this chapter, we will introduce the sample application we will use throughout the book and explore modeling techniques, such as domain storytelling and EventStorming, to enhance our collective understanding of a problem in a reliable and structured manner.</p>
			<p>The following topics will be covered in this chapter:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Introducing the example application (a letter of credit)</li>
				<li>Enhancing shared understanding</li>
				<li>Domain storytelling</li>
				<li>EventStorming</li>
			</ul>
			<p>This chapter will help developers and architects learn how to apply these techniques in real-life situations to produce elegant software solutions that mirror the domain problem that needs to be solved. Similarly, non-technical domain experts will understand how to communicate their ideas and collaborate effectively with technical team members to accelerate the process of arriving at a shared understanding.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-67"><a id="_idTextAnchor066"/>Technical requirements</h1>
			<p>There are no specific technical requirements for this chapter. However, given that it may become necessary to collaborate remotely as opposed to being in the same room with access to a whiteboard, it will be useful to have access to the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>A digital whiteboard (such as <a href="https://www.mural.co/">https://www.mural.co/</a> or <a href="http://miro.com/">http://miro.com/</a>)</li>
				<li>An online domain storytelling modeler (such as <a href="https://www.wps.de/modeler/">https://www.wps.de/modeler/</a>)</li>
			</ul>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-68"><a id="_idTextAnchor067"/>Understanding a letter of credit</h1>
			<p>A documentary <strong class="bold">Letter of Credit</strong> (<strong class="bold">LC</strong>) is a financial instrument issued by banks as a contract between an importer (or buyer) and an exporter (or seller). This contract specifies the terms <a id="_idIndexMarker256"/>and conditions of the transaction, under which the importer promises to pay the exporter in exchange for the goods or services provided by the exporter. An LC transaction typically involves multiple parties. A simplified summary of the parties involved is described as follows:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Importer</strong>: The buyer <a id="_idIndexMarker257"/>of the goods or services.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Exporter</strong>: The seller of the goods or services.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Freight forwarder</strong>: The agency that handles the shipment of goods on behalf of the exporter. This is only applicable in cases where there is an exchange of physical goods.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Issuing bank</strong>: The bank that the importer requests to issue the LC application. Usually, the importer has a preexisting relationship with this bank.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Advising bank</strong>: The bank that informs the exporter about the issuance of the LC. This is usually a bank that is native to the exporter’s country.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Negotiating bank</strong>: The bank that the exporter submits documents for the shipment of goods, or the services provided. Usually, the exporter has a preexisting relationship with this bank.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Reimbursement bank</strong>: The bank that reimburses the funds to the negotiating bank, at the request of the issuing bank.</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="callout-heading">Note</p>
			<p class="callout">One bank can play more than one role in a given transaction. In the most complex cases, there can be four distinct banks involved in a transaction (sometimes even more, but we will skip those cases for brevity).</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-69"><a id="_idTextAnchor068"/>An LC issuance application</h1>
			<p>As discovered in the previous chapter, Kosmo Primo Bank needs us to focus on streamlining the process used for LC application and issuance functions. In this chapter, and indeed the rest <a id="_idIndexMarker258"/>of this book, we will strive to understand, evolve, design, and build a software solution to make the process more efficient by replacing the largely manual and error-prone workflows with more simplified processes, based on larger amounts of automation.</p>
			<p>We understand that unless you are an expert dealing with international trade, it is unlikely that you will have an intimate understanding of concepts such as LCs. In the upcoming section, we will look at demystifying LCs and how to work with them.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-70"><a id="_idTextAnchor069"/>Enhancing shared understanding</h1>
			<p>When working with a problem where domain concepts are unclear, there is a need to arrive at a common <a id="_idIndexMarker259"/>understanding among key team members (both those that have bright ideas – the business/product people, and those that translate those ideas into working software – the software developers). For this process to be effective, we tend to look for approaches that are as follows:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Quick, informal, and effective</li>
				<li>Collaborative – easy to learn and adopt for both non-technical and technical team members</li>
				<li>Pictorial, because a picture can be worth a thousand words</li>
				<li>Usable for both coarse-grained and fine-grained scenarios</li>
			</ul>
			<p>There are several means to arrive at this shared understanding. The following are some of the commonly used approaches:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>UML</li>
				<li>BPMN</li>
				<li>Use cases</li>
				<li>User story mapping</li>
				<li>CRC models</li>
				<li>Data flow diagrams</li>
			</ul>
			<p>These modeling techniques try to formalize knowledge and express it in the form of a diagram or text to help deliver business requirements as a software product. However, this attempt has not narrowed but widened the gap between business and software systems. While <a id="_idIndexMarker260"/>these methods tend to work well for technical audiences, they are usually not as appealing to non-technical users.</p>
			<p>In order to restore the balance and promote the use of techniques that can work for both parties, we will use <strong class="bold">domain storytelling</strong> and <strong class="bold">EventStorming</strong> as our means to capture business knowledge from domain experts for the consumption of developers and business analysts, among others.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-71"><a id="_idTextAnchor070"/>Domain storytelling</h1>
			<p>Scientific research has now proven that learning methods that employ audiovisual aids assist both teachers <a id="_idIndexMarker261"/>and students in retaining and internalizing concepts very effectively. In addition, teaching what we have learned helps reinforce ideas and stimulate the formation of new ones.</p>
			<p>Domain storytelling is a collaborative modeling technique that combines a pictorial language, real-world examples, and a workshop format to serve as a very simple, quick, and effective technique for sharing knowledge among team members. Domain storytelling is a technique invented and popularized by Stefan Hofer and Henning Schwentner, based on some <a id="_idIndexMarker262"/>related work done at the University of Hamburg called <em class="italic">cooperation pictures</em>.</p>
			<p>A pictorial <a id="_idIndexMarker263"/>notation of the technique is illustrated in the following diagram:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer064" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B16716_04_01.jpg" alt="Figure 4.1 – Domain storytelling summarized&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 4.1 – Domain storytelling summarized</p>
			<p>A domain story is conveyed using the following attributes:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Actors</strong>: Stories are communicated from the perspective of an actor (noun) – for example, the <a id="_idIndexMarker264"/>issuing bank, which plays an active role in the context of a particular story. It is a good practice to use the ubiquitous language for the particular domain.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Work objects</strong>: Actors act on some object – for example, applying for an LC. Again, this would be a term (noun) commonly used in the domain.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Activities</strong>: Actions (verb) performed by the actor on a work object. Represented by a labeled arrow connecting the actor and the work object.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Annotations</strong>: Used to capture additional information as part of the story, usually represented in a few sentences.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Sequence numbers</strong>: Usually, stories are told one sentence after the other. Sequence numbers help capture the sequence of activities in a story.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Groups</strong>: An outline to represent a collection of related concepts, ranging from repeated/optional activities to subdomains/organizational boundaries.</li>
			</ul>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-72"><a id="_idTextAnchor071"/>Using DST for an LC application</h2>
			<p>KP Bank has a process that allows the processing of LCs. However, this process is very archaic, paper-based, and manually intensive. Very few at the bank fully understand the process end <a id="_idIndexMarker265"/>to end, and natural attrition has meant that the process is overly complex without good reason. So, they are <a id="_idIndexMarker266"/>looking to digitize and simplify this process. DST itself is just a graphical notation that can be done in isolation. However, it is typical to not do this on your own and employ a workshop style, with domain experts and software experts working collaboratively.</p>
			<p>In this section, we will employ a DST workshop to capture the current business flow. The following is an excerpt of such a conversation between <em class="italic">Katie</em>, <em class="italic">the domain expert</em>, and <em class="italic">Patrick</em>, <em class="italic">the software developer</em>:</p>
			<p><strong class="bold">Patrick</strong>: <em class="italic">Can you give me a high-level overview of a typical LC flow?</em></p>
			<p><strong class="bold">Katie</strong>: <em class="italic">Sure, it all begins with the importer and the exporter entering into a contract for the purchase of goods or services.</em></p>
			<p><strong class="bold">Patrick</strong>: <em class="italic">What form does this contract take? Is it a formal document clause? Or is this just a conversation?</em></p>
			<p><strong class="bold">Katie</strong>: <em class="italic">This is just a conversation.</em></p>
			<p><strong class="bold">Patrick</strong>: <em class="italic">Oh okay. What does the conversation cover?</em></p>
			<p><strong class="bold">Katie</strong>: <em class="italic">Several things – the nature and quantity of goods, pricing details, payment terms, shipment costs and timelines, insurance, and warranty, among other things. These details can be captured in a purchase order – which is a simple document clause elaborating the aforementioned.</em></p>
			<p>At this time, Patrick <a id="_idIndexMarker267"/>draws this part of the <a id="_idIndexMarker268"/>interaction between the importer and the exporter. This graphic is depicted in the following diagram:</p>

			<p><strong class="bold">Patrick</strong>: <em class="italic">This seems straightforward, so where does the bank come into the picture?</em></p>
			<p><strong class="bold">Katie</strong>: <em class="italic">This is an international trade, and both the importer and the exporter need to mitigate the financial risk involved in such business transactions. So, they involve a bank as a trusted mediator.</em></p>
			<p><strong class="bold">Patric</strong>: <em class="italic">What kind of bank is this?</em></p>
			<p><strong class="bold">Katie</strong>: <em class="italic">Usually, there are multiple banks involved. But it all starts with an </em><strong class="bold">issuing bank</strong><em class="italic">.</em></p>
			<p><strong class="bold">Patrick</strong>: <em class="italic">What is an issuing bank?</em></p>
			<p><strong class="bold">Katie</strong>: <em class="italic">Any bank that is authorized to mediate international trade deals. This has to be a bank in the importer’s country.</em></p>
			<p><strong class="bold">Patrick</strong>: <em class="italic">Does the importer need to have an existing relationship with this bank?</em></p>
			<p><strong class="bold">Katie</strong>: <em class="italic">Not necessarily. There may be other banks with whom the importer may have a relationship – which, in turn, liaise with the issuing bank on the importer’s behalf. But to keep it simple, let’s assume that the importer has an existing relationship with the issuing bank – which is our bank, in this case.</em></p>
			<p><strong class="bold">Patrick</strong>: <em class="italic">Does the importer provide details of the purchase order to the issuing bank to get started?</em></p>
			<p><strong class="bold">Katie</strong>: <em class="italic">Yes. The importer provides the details of the transaction by making an </em><strong class="bold">LC application</strong><em class="italic">.</em></p>

			<p>We have now looked at an excerpt of a typical DST workshop. It has provided a reasonably <a id="_idIndexMarker269"/>good understanding <a id="_idIndexMarker270"/>of the high-level business flow. Note that we have not referenced any technical artifacts during the process.</p>
			<p>To refine this flow and convert it into a form that can be used to design a software solution, we will need to further enhance this view. In the upcoming section, we will use <strong class="bold">EventStorming</strong> as a structured approach to achieve that.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-73"><a id="_idTextAnchor072"/>EventStorming</h1>
			<p class="author-quote">“The amount of energy necessary to refute bullshit is an order of magnitude bigger than to produce it.”</p>
			<p class="author-quote">– Alberto Brandolini</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-74"><a id="_idTextAnchor073"/>Introducing EventStorming</h2>
			<p>In the previous section, we gained a high-level understanding of the LC issuance process. To be able to build <a id="_idIndexMarker271"/>a real-world application, it helps to use a method that delves into the next level of detail. EventStorming, originally conceived by Alberto Brandolini, is one such method for the collaborative exploration of complex domains.</p>
			<p>In this method, you simply start by listing all the events that are significant to a business domain in roughly chronological order on a wall or whiteboard, using a bunch of colored sticky notes. Each of the note types (denoted by different colors) serves a specific purpose, as outlined here:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Domain event</strong>: An event that <a id="_idIndexMarker272"/>is significant to the business process – expressed in the past tense.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Command</strong>: An action or an activity that may result in one or more domain events occurring. This is either <a id="_idIndexMarker273"/>user-initiated or system-initiated, in response to a domain event.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">User</strong>: A person who <a id="_idIndexMarker274"/>performs a business action/activity.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Policy</strong>: A set of business <a id="_idIndexMarker275"/>invariants (rules) that need to be adhered to for an action/activity to be successfully performed.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Query/read model</strong>: A piece <a id="_idIndexMarker276"/>of information required to perform an action/activity.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">External system</strong>: A system <a id="_idIndexMarker277"/>significant to the business process but out of scope in the current context.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Hotspot</strong>: A point of <a id="_idIndexMarker278"/>contention within the system that is likely confusing and/or puzzling beyond a small subsection of the team.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Aggregate</strong>: An object <a id="_idIndexMarker279"/>graph whose state changes consistently and atomically. This is consistent with the definition of <em class="italic">aggregates</em> we saw in <a href="B16716_02_Final_NM_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor037"><em class="italic">Chapter 2</em></a>, <em class="italic">Where and How Does DDD Fit?</em>.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The depiction of the stickies for our EventStorming workshop is shown here:</p>

			<p class="callout-heading">Why Domain Events?</p>
			<p class="callout">When trying to understand a business process, it is convenient to explain significant facts or things in that <a id="_idIndexMarker280"/>context. This practice can also be informal and easy for uninitiated audiences. This provides an easy-to-digest visual representation of domain complexity.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-75"><a id="_idTextAnchor074"/>Using EventStorming for the LC issuance application</h2>
			<p>Now that we have <a id="_idIndexMarker281"/>a high-level understanding <a id="_idIndexMarker282"/>of the current business process, thanks to the domain storytelling workshop, let’s look at how we can delve deeper using EventStorming. The following is an excerpt of the stages from an EventStorming workshop for the same application:</p>
			<ol>
				<li><strong class="bold">Outline the event chronology</strong>: During this exercise, we recall significant <strong class="bold">domain events</strong> (using orange stickies) in the system and paste them on the whiteboard, as <a id="_idIndexMarker283"/>depicted in the following diagram. We ensure <a id="_idIndexMarker284"/>that the event stickies are pasted roughly in the chronological order of occurrence. As the timeline is enforced, the business flow will begin to emerge:</li>
			</ol>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer072" class="IMG---Figure">

				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 4.9 – Event chronology</p>
			<p>This acts as an aid in understanding the big picture. This also enables people in the room to identify hotspots in the existing business process. In the preceding diagram, the process to handle <em class="italic">declined LC applications</em> is suboptimal – that is, the applicants do not receive any information when their application is declined.</p>
			<p>To address this, we added a new domain event that explicitly indicates that an application is declined, as depicted in the following diagram:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer073" class="IMG---Figure">

			<p class="callout-heading">Important note</p>
			<p class="callout">For both the domain storytelling and EventStorming workshops, it works best when we have approximately six to eight people participating with the right mix of domain and technology experts.</p>
			<p>This concludes the EventStorming workshop to gain a reasonably detailed understanding of the LC application and issuance process. Does this mean that we have concluded the domain requirements gathering process? Not at all – while we have made significant <a id="_idIndexMarker292"/>strides in understanding the domain, there is still a long way to go. The process of elaborating domain requirements is perpetual. Where are we in this continuum? The following diagram is an attempt to clarify:</p>

			<p>In subsequent <a id="_idIndexMarker293"/>chapters, we will examine the other techniques in more detail.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-76"><a id="_idTextAnchor075"/>Summary</h1>
			<p>In this chapter, we examined two ways to enhance our collective understanding of a problem domain using two lightweight modeling techniques – domain storytelling and EventStorming.</p>
			<p>Domain storytelling uses a simple pictorial notation to share business knowledge among domain experts and technical team members. EventStorming, on the other hand, uses a chronological ordering of domain events that occur as part of the business process to gain that same shared understanding.</p>
			<p>Domain storytelling can be used as an introductory technique to establish a high-level understanding of a problem space, while EventStorming can be used to inform detailed design decisions of a solution space.</p>
			<p>With this knowledge, we should be able to dive deeper into the technical aspects of solution implementation. In the next chapter, we will start the implementation of business logic and model our aggregate, along with commands and domain events.</p>
