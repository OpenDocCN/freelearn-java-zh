- en: OpenJDK is a unique project that opens numerous and exciting opportunities for
    people who want to dive into the huge and complicated infrastructure behind the
    JVM. There is an incredible amount of things to learn and to explore. Almost anyone
    can find something in it as per their interest, starting from HTTP, Web, software
    dependency problems, and ending with hardware-specific JIT optimization techniques,
    and concurrency challenges. Such variety is very unique and it would be true to
    say that there is no other open source project that can provide something similar.
    The other factor is that there are not so many other open source projects on that
    scale; possibly only the Linux core. Such scale requires a non-trivial organizational
    approach and, to be involved in that process, to see how it works, is a very interesting
    insight.

- en: This cookbook will lead you through steps to take you into the world of OpenJDK
    as smoothly as possible. It starts by explaining how to download the source code
    and how to build the different versions of OpenJDK, how to set it up on a machine,
    and what different options are available. Then, you will learn how to set up the
    development environment (IDE) required for editing and debugging C++ and Java
    source code, and how to start making changes. It will go through some examples,
    which you may decide to change in various parts of OpenJDK. Further, it will cover
    the tools available for testing, benchmarking, and ensuring that the changes you
    have made are not breaking the existing functionality. As OpenJDK is a big project
    with its own rules and processes, there will be a part covering the procedures
    that are involved in making changes or fixing bugs, the lifecycle of projects,
    JSRs, JEPs, and so on. At the end, there will be a section about future work that
    is planned to be included in forthcoming releases; that part will be the most
    interesting section for anyone who is interested in the future direction of OpenJDK
    and wants to try something new, which is not yet available in the stable product.
