But while writing, we came to realize that it would be interesting to make a clear and concise presentation of the relevant specifications and how to implement them. This led us to imagine a project that will help present almost all the specifications affected by Java EE 7 and how to put them together in order to build a large-scale application.</p><p>In short, this book does not aim to show how to implement the different aspects of each Java EE 7 specification or list the best practices. Rather, it positions itself similar to the yellow pages for a city that has been built recently. In other words, this book will help you discover the innovations introduced by Java EE 7 and give you ideas to build solid applications.</p><div class="section" title="What this book covers"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl1sec02"/>What this book covers</h1></div></div></div><p><a class="link" href="ch01.html" title="Chapter 1. What's New in Java EE 7">Chapter 1</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>What's New in Java EE 7</em></span>, gives an overview of the improvements made in the Java EE 7 platform.</p><p><a class="link" href="ch02.html" title="Chapter 2. New Specifications">Chapter 2</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>New Specifications</em></span>, explains concepts concerning the new specifications that have been added in Java EE 7 and shows how they can be used.</p><p><a class="link" href="ch03.html" title="Chapter 3. The Presentation Layer">Chapter 3</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>The Presentation Layer</em></span>, demonstrates the implementation of the improvements brought by the Java EE 7 platform for the presentation layer specifications.</p><p><a class="link" href="ch04.html" title="Chapter 4. The Java Persistence API">Chapter 4</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>The Java Persistence API</em></span>, shows how your Java application can store and retrieve data from the database in a safe way and explains the innovations that have been made in the relevant specifications.</p><p><a class="link" href="ch05.html" title="Chapter 5. The Business Layer">Chapter 5</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>The Business Layer</em></span>, begins by giving a presentation of the improvement in the business layer and then demonstrates how various Java EE 7 specifications can be put together for the realization of an application.</p><p><a class="link" href="ch06.html" title="Chapter 6. Communicating with External Systems">Chapter 6</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Communicating with External Systems</em></span>, demonstrates how a Java EE 7 application can interact with heterogeneous systems.</p><p><a class="link" href="ch07.html" title="Chapter 7. Annotations and CDI">Chapter 7</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Annotations and CDI</em></span>, explains how annotations and CDI can be used to improve the quality of applications.</p><p><a class="link" href="ch08.html" title="Chapter 8. Validators and Interceptors">Chapter 8</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Validators and Interceptors</em></span>, shows how the validation and interception of data can be implemented in a Java EE environment to ensure the quality of the data handled by an application.</p><p><a class="link" href="ch09.html" title="Chapter 9. Security">Chapter 9</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Security</em></span>, demonstrates the implementation of security and setting up a personal module for security in Servlet and EJB containers.</p></div></div>
