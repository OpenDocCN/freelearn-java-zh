- en: 'A solid software architecture combines every building block required to bring
    a tech solution to life. In the early days of an application’s life, the design
    and practices are established: microservice or monolith architecture, event-driven
    approach, the integration and delivery application life cycle, containerization,
    and so on. Restricting the application side, especially in a Java context, frameworks
    and execution runtimes are also defined. Like the good old legacy systems, most
    modern cloud-native solutions rely on data, generally in data stores (e.g., databases).
    Unfortunately, the persistence layer is often left aside and not treated with
    the same importance as these other topics. For scenarios dependent on stateful
    services, this is the beginning of the end – the brand-new solution is doomed
    for a life of performance struggles and reduced maintainability, or even worse,
    might have ingrained weeds causing data inconsistency. The reduced maintainability
    is a result of the neglect in the persistence layer design and definitions, as
    schemes and data models are poorly implemented on top of insufficient information.
    In such scenarios, even trivial database refactorings are brutal and time-consuming.'

- en: This book presents well-established patterns and standards that can be used
    in Java solutions, with valuable pros and cons of the trendy technologies and
    frameworks used in cloud-native microservices when confronted with good Java coding
    practices. As Java technologies have been broadly used for over two decades now,
    cloud adoption puts extra challenges on the table, such as the growing need for
    cost reduction through stack modernization. So, you will learn about application
    modernization strategies and gain in-depth knowledge about how enterprise data
    integration patterns and event-driven architectures enable smooth modernization
    processes with low-to-zero impact on the existing legacy stack.

    backed by a thorough explanation of data storage options and their respective
    recommended usage scenarios, covering technologies such as SQL, NoSQL, and NewSQL.
    When talking about data-related content tailored within a Java ecosystem’s context,
    extensive information is available on topics such as how MicroProfile and Jakarta
    EE work; database patterns (such as Active Record and **Data Access Object** (**DAO**);
    **Command and Query Responsibility Segregation** (**CQRS**); in-memory persistence;
    and frameworks for object mapping.

    to the Clouds*, is where you will acquire the foundation knowledge you’ll need
    for what’s coming next in the book, so buckle up. You will learn about the challenges
    of storing data, which gave birth to the first data storage solutions. As technology
    advanced, databases evolved into robust and reliable solutions. The Java ecosystem
    responded well and grew along with the data ecosystem, providing users with frameworks,
    application servers, and so on to allow for a simpler developer experience yet

    with the growth and individual needs of decoupled and independent services. You
    will explore different ways to store data, market data management systems (e.g.,
    relational, NoSQL, and NewSQL), their respective languages, and, most importantly,
    the use case scenarios for each of them. Overengineering is the villain in system
    design, so this chapter will prepare you with the knowledge to keep it far from

    between monoliths, microservices, and event-driven solutions, and how these approaches
    push the increasing adoption of different cloud service offerings. You will learn
    how to identify the benefits and disadvantages of using a mix of on-premises and
    cloud solutions, a mix that results in organizations’ solutions being built on
