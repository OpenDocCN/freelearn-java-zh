			<h1 id="_idParaDest-349"><a id="_idTextAnchor348"/>Introduction to AI in Java</h1>
			<p>Software developers<a id="_idIndexMarker984"/> at all levels of experience have embraced AI as part of their workflows. AI-related tools and techniques can significantly enhance our ability to develop high-performing Java applications. There are two aspects for us to consider. First, we can use AI tools to help us develop, test, and enhance our code. Secondly, we can incorporate AI into our applications to introduce innovation and <span class="No-Break">enhance functionality.</span></p>
			<p>In this section, we will look at AI’s relevance to high-performing Java applications, current trends in AI for Java, and future directions <span class="No-Break">for AI.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-350"><a id="_idTextAnchor349"/>AI’s relevance to high-performance Java applications</h2>
			<p>The power of AI technologies<a id="_idIndexMarker985"/> is undeniable. With ML, a subset of AI, we can train models to make advanced predictions, analyze data, and automate complex tasks. Java developers can leverage these capabilities to improve their development, testing, and maintenance of <span class="No-Break">Java projects.</span></p>
			<p>Here are four key methods by which we can leverage AI as part of our Java development and system <span class="No-Break">support efforts:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Automated monitoring</strong>: We can use AI to enhance legacy monitoring tools. This can lead to automated anomaly, bug, and bottleneck detection. The output is alerts that let us stay informed of our system’s performance and provide targeted refactoring and optimization. The use of automated monitoring with AI can minimize downtime and safeguard the <span class="No-Break">user experience.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Performance optimization</strong>: AI can analyze large data sets quickly, which can be leveraged to help us identify bottlenecks. Moreover, AI can suggest optimizations based on its own analysis. Taking this a step further, we can use ML models to predict which parts of our code are most likely to cause issues. This lets us be proactive instead of reactive with <span class="No-Break">our optimizations.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Predicative analytics</strong>: AI and ML models are increasingly being used in various industries to make predictions based on dataset and trend analysis. For Java developers, this can take the form of forecasting future system loads and performance issues. This allows us to make informed decisions about infrastructure, scaling, and <span class="No-Break">resource allocation.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Predictive maintenance</strong>: Employing predictive maintenance models can help us accurately anticipate future failures, both in hardware and software. This allows us to plan, take preventative maintenance actions, prevent performance degradation, and improve the overall efficiency of <span class="No-Break">our systems.</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>Now that we have a sense<a id="_idIndexMarker986"/> of how we can leverage AI for high-performance Java applications, let’s look at some current trends related to AI <span class="No-Break">in Java.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-351"><a id="_idTextAnchor350"/>Current trends</h2>
			<p>There are four AI-related trends<a id="_idIndexMarker987"/> that are shaping how Java developers integrate AI and harness <span class="No-Break">its power:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Cloud services</strong>: Each of the major<a id="_idIndexMarker988"/> cloud service providers (<strong class="bold">Amazon Web Services</strong> (<strong class="bold">AWS</strong>), <strong class="bold">Google Cloud</strong>, and <strong class="bold">Microsoft Azure</strong>) has AI services<a id="_idIndexMarker989"/> that can be integrated with Java applications. The models vary among service providers and generally provide<a id="_idIndexMarker990"/> pre-built<a id="_idIndexMarker991"/> models and <strong class="bold">Application Programming Interfaces</strong> (<strong class="bold">APIs</strong>) for <a id="_idIndexMarker992"/>complex<a id="_idIndexMarker993"/> tasks<a id="_idIndexMarker994"/> such as <strong class="bold">image recognition</strong>, <strong class="bold">predictive analytics</strong>, and <strong class="bold">Natural Language </strong><span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">Processing</strong></span><span class="No-Break"> (</span><span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">NLP</strong></span><span class="No-Break">).</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Edge AI</strong>: The concept of <strong class="bold">edge computing</strong> was realized with the wide<a id="_idIndexMarker995"/> adoption of cloud<a id="_idIndexMarker996"/> services. The concept is simply deploying systems and data close to the user to increase response times and reduce network latency. <strong class="bold">Edge AI</strong>, an extension of edge computing, involves deploying AI models on <span class="No-Break">edge devices.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Libraries and frameworks</strong>: There is an increasing number of AI-specific libraries and frameworks<a id="_idIndexMarker997"/> becoming available to Java developers. The goal of these libraries and frameworks is to simplify our implementation of AI models in Java applications. Notable libraries and frameworks worth researching include <span class="No-Break">the following:</span><ul><li>Apache <span class="No-Break">Spark MLlib</span></li><li><strong class="bold">Deep Java </strong><span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">Library</strong></span><span class="No-Break"> (</span><span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">DJL</strong></span><span class="No-Break">)</span></li><li>TensorFlow <span class="No-Break">for Java</span></li></ul></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Transparency</strong>: As our use of AI increases, the need to document how AI decisions are made are understandable. <strong class="bold">Explainable AI</strong> (<strong class="bold">XAI</strong>) calls for AI decisions<a id="_idIndexMarker998"/> and processes to <span class="No-Break">be transparent.</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>The trends that we have described<a id="_idIndexMarker999"/> are currently seen in the industry. The next section reveals what we might see in <span class="No-Break">the future.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-352"><a id="_idTextAnchor351"/>Future directions</h2>
			<p>The efficiencies and capabilities<a id="_idIndexMarker1000"/> we can currently gain from the use of AI tools and technologies are impressive. It is exciting to consider which future directions these tools and technologies might take and how we might be able to leverage them to enhance our ability to create and maintain high-performing Java applications. Here are four <span class="No-Break">future trends:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">AI-driven development tools</strong>: As AI tools and techniques<a id="_idIndexMarker1001"/> become mature, they are likely<a id="_idIndexMarker1002"/> to be built into our <strong class="bold">integrated development environments</strong> (<strong class="bold">IDEs</strong>). AI-specific development tools, a new breed of IDEs, could emerge for our use in the next couple <span class="No-Break">of years.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">AI for cybersecurity</strong>: Cybersecurity’s importance increases<a id="_idIndexMarker1003"/> as new AI tools and technologies are released. AI can be used to detect and even respond to cybersecurity threats to our systems. This capability is likely to increase in the <span class="No-Break">coming years.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Hybrid models</strong>: It is common for similar technologies<a id="_idIndexMarker1004"/> to be introduced independently and then later combined<a id="_idIndexMarker1005"/> to form a hybrid model. For example, <strong class="bold">augmented reality</strong> and <strong class="bold">virtual reality</strong> were introduced <a id="_idIndexMarker1006"/>separately and later formed a hybrid<a id="_idIndexMarker1007"/> model referred to as <strong class="bold">mixed reality</strong>. This is like with AI, ML, deep learning, and other <span class="No-Break">related systems.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Quantum computing</strong>: Quantum computing is a field<a id="_idIndexMarker1008"/> that is ripe for the use of AI. The power of quantum computing’s computing power married with the intelligence of AI stands to revolutionize AI and how we <span class="No-Break">use it.</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>AI tools and technologies<a id="_idIndexMarker1009"/> can enhance our high-performance Java toolkits. By understanding and leveraging AI technologies, we can create applications that are not only efficient and scalable but also intelligent and adaptive. In the next section, we will take a specific look at AI for <span class="No-Break">performance optimization.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-353"><a id="_idTextAnchor352"/>AI for performance optimization</h1>
			<p>As we discussed in the previous section, AI represents<a id="_idIndexMarker1010"/> an incredible opportunity for developers to enhance their performance optimization efforts and improve their results. By adopting a set of AI tools and models, we can efficiently improve our applications as part of a continuous improvement mindset. For example, the predictive abilities of AI can help us predict bottlenecks before they happen. Imagine updating your code to prevent a bottleneck or resource depletion without any system user being impacted. We no longer need to wait for complaints of low responsiveness<a id="_idIndexMarker1011"/> or read logs to see errors <span class="No-Break">and alerts.</span></p>
			<p>Next, we will look at how we can use AI for code optimization and <span class="No-Break">performance fine-tuning.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-354"><a id="_idTextAnchor353"/>Code optimization and performance tuning</h2>
			<p>AI is highly capable<a id="_idIndexMarker1012"/> of analyzing existing code<a id="_idIndexMarker1013"/> and providing optimization insights. This is possible by training ML models to identify code patterns that are inefficient, code that might lead to memory leaks, and additional <span class="No-Break">performance issues.</span></p>
			<p>Let’s illustrate this with an example. The code that follows uses an inefficient way of data processing. This might not be noticed when monitoring your application but could become catastrophic if the data were to grow exponentially. Here is the <span class="No-Break">inefficient code:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;
public class CH18Example1 {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    CH18Example1 example = new CH18Example1();
    example.processData();
  }
  public void processData() {
    List&lt;Integer&gt; data = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;();
    for (int i = 0; i &lt; 1000000; i++) {
      data.add(i);
  }
  int sum = 0;
  for (Integer num : data) {
    sum += num;
  }
  System.out.println("Sum: " + sum);
  }
}</pre>			<p>The AI-optimized code<a id="_idIndexMarker1014"/> is provided next. A description<a id="_idIndexMarker1015"/> of the optimizations follows <span class="No-Break">the code:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
import java.util.stream.IntStream;
public class CH18Example2 {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    CH18Example2 example = new CH18Example2();
    example.processData();
  }
  public void processData() {
    int sum = IntStream.range(0, 1000000).sum();
    System.out.println("Sum: " + sum);
  }
}</pre>			<p>Using AI, the code has been optimized in three <span class="No-Break">specific ways:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li>The optimized code no longer uses an <strong class="source-inline">ArrayList</strong>. This is a smart change because that data structure can consume a lot of memory and increase the time it takes to process <span class="No-Break">its contents.</span></li>
				<li>The code now uses an <strong class="source-inline">IntStream.range</strong> to generate the range of integers. It also computes the sum without the need to create an interim collection <span class="No-Break">to store.</span></li>
				<li>Lastly, the optimized code uses Java’s <strong class="source-inline">IntStream</strong> to efficiently handle the range of integers and perform the summation operation. Here, our code benefits from the inherent optimized nature of Streams’ <span class="No-Break">better performance.</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>AI was able to make three optimizations<a id="_idIndexMarker1016"/> to our simple but<a id="_idIndexMarker1017"/> inefficient code. Imagine what it could do for more <span class="No-Break">robust applications.</span></p>
			<p>Next, let’s examine how ML models can predict issues such <span class="No-Break">as bottlenecks.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-355"><a id="_idTextAnchor354"/>Predicting performance bottlenecks</h2>
			<p>ML models can be taught<a id="_idIndexMarker1018"/> to predict performance bottlenecks. These models learn by ingesting historical performance data. From there, they can identify patterns that are likely to lead to a performance bottleneck. To demonstrate<a id="_idIndexMarker1019"/> this, we will use the <strong class="bold">Waikato Environment for Knowledge Analysis</strong> (<span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">WEKA</strong></span><span class="No-Break">) platform.</span></p>
			<p class="callout-heading">WEKA</p>
			<p class="callout">WEKA is an ML and data<a id="_idIndexMarker1020"/> analysis platform. It is free software issued under the GNU General <span class="No-Break">Public License.</span></p>
			<p>Here is a simple ML example that we can use to predict <span class="No-Break">performance bottlenecks:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
import weka.classifiers.Classifier;
import weka.core.Instances;
import weka.core.converters.ConverterUtils.DataSource;
public class CH18Example3 {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        DataSource source = new DataSource("path/to/performance_data.
        arff");
        Instances data = source.getDataSet();
        data.setClassIndex(data.numAttributes() - 1);
        Classifier classifier = (Classifier) weka.core.
        SerializationHelper.read("path/to/model.model");
        double prediction = classifier.classifyInstance(data.
        instance(0));
        System.out.println("Predicted Performance: " + prediction);
    }
}</pre>			<p>We used the Weka library to load historical performance data and then, using a pre-trained <strong class="source-inline">classifier</strong> model, predict potential performance issues. Here is some simulated output we might expect from <span class="No-Break">our code:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
Predicted Performance: Bottleneck</pre>			<p>There are a lot of assumptions that come with the preceding simulated output. For context, let’s assume that we trained<a id="_idIndexMarker1021"/> our Weka model to classify code as either <strong class="source-inline">Normal</strong> <span class="No-Break">or </span><span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">Bottleneck</strong></span><span class="No-Break">.</span></p>
			<p>Let’s now move on to a review of a real-world <span class="No-Break">case study.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-356"><a id="_idTextAnchor355"/>Abbreviated case study</h2>
			<p>This section provides an abbreviated case study<a id="_idIndexMarker1022"/> to help illustrate the practical application of using AI for performance optimizations. The case study uses a Java-based web application scenario experiencing lag during peak <span class="No-Break">usage times.</span></p>
			<ol>
				<li><strong class="bold">Phase 1</strong>: The first phase of this case study involved data collection. This included gathering specific performance metrics including response times, memory and CPU use, transaction rates, and more. This was collected by the development team and consisted of 12 months’ worth <span class="No-Break">of data.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Phase 2</strong>: Now that the development team had 12 months of performance data, they trained an ML model to predict potential performance bottlenecks. This training led to the model’s ability to identify patterns in the data that led to <span class="No-Break">performance degradation.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Phase 3</strong>: At this point, the development team had the data and the trained ML model. Next came the implementation phase, wherein they integrated the now-trained model into their application monitoring system. The system monitoring resulted in alerts and optimization scripts when a bottleneck was predicted. The optimized scripts were designed to adjust resource allocation and optimize <span class="No-Break">database queries.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Phase 4</strong>: This final phase was the results phase. The development team had successfully collected data, then trained an ML model and implemented it in their monitoring system. The results were significant and included a 35% improvement in response times and a 42% decrease <span class="No-Break">in slowdowns.</span></li>
			</ol>
			<p>This case study demonstrates<a id="_idIndexMarker1023"/> practical applications with tangible benefits of using AI to help us <span class="No-Break">optimize performance.</span></p>
			<p>Our next section will focus on leveraging the power of AI to help us monitor and maintain <span class="No-Break">our code.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-357"><a id="_idTextAnchor356"/>AI-powered monitoring and maintenance</h1>
			<p>We covered the critical purpose of monitoring and maintenance extensively in <a href="B21942_16.xhtml#_idTextAnchor307"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 16</em></span></a>, <em class="italic">Code Monitoring and Maintenance</em>. We can extend that topic beyond the manual interventions and predefined benchmarks and thresholds. AI-powered monitoring and maintenance presents a shift toward a proactive and efficient approach that uses ML and other AI techniques to detect anomalies, predict bottlenecks and failures, and <span class="No-Break">automate responses.</span></p>
			<p>This section looks at how we can leverage AI for anomaly detection, automated monitoring, logging, and alerting. We will also explore maintenance strategies that use predictive maintenance models. Let’s get started with a look at anomaly detection <span class="No-Break">using AI.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-358"><a id="_idTextAnchor357"/>Anomaly detection</h2>
			<p>One of the primary goals<a id="_idIndexMarker1024"/> of monitoring is to detect anomalies that can lead to significant issues. AI’s ability to ingest and analyze copious amounts of data empowers it to detect anomalies when the data is being reviewed by non-AI tools <span class="No-Break">or humans.</span></p>
			<p>The code that follows is an example Java application that uses an AI model for anomaly detection. In particular, this example looks at <span class="No-Break">performance metrics:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
import org.deeplearning4j.nn.multilayer.MultiLayerNetwork;
import org.deeplearning4j.util.ModelSerializer;
import org.nd4j.linalg.api.ndarray.INDArray;
import org.nd4j.linalg.factory.Nd4j;
public class CH18Example4 {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        MultiLayerNetwork model = ModelSerializer.
        restoreMultiLayerNetwork("path/my_anomaly_model.zip");
        double[] performanceMetrics = {75.0, 85.7, 500, 150};
        INDArray input = Nd4j.create(performanceMetrics);
        INDArray output = model.output(input);
        double anomalyScore = output.getDouble(0);
        System.out.println("Anomaly Detection System Report (ADSR): 
        Anomaly Score: " + anomalyScore);
        if (anomalyScore &gt; 0.3) {
            System.out.println("Anomaly Detection System Report 
            (ADSR): Anomaly detected!");
        } else {
            System.out.println("Anomaly Detection System Report 
            (ADSR): System is operating normally.");
        }
    }
}</pre>			<p>Our preceding example uses a neural network model to analyze performance metrics. The computation results in an anomaly score with output that varies based on the score. This can be used to help identify<a id="_idIndexMarker1025"/> areas that we need to review or trigger an <span class="No-Break">automated response.</span></p>
			<p>Next, let’s look at how AI can be used for logging <span class="No-Break">and alerting.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-359"><a id="_idTextAnchor358"/>AI-based logging</h2>
			<p>As expected, we can use AI<a id="_idIndexMarker1026"/> to enhance our logging and alerting systems. AI tools can provide us with more efficient and contextual alerts than otherwise possible. Let’s look at a simple implementation of an AI logging system that <span class="No-Break">includes alerting:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
import org.apache.logging.log4j.LogManager;
import org.apache.logging.log4j.Logger;
public class CH18Example5 {
    private static final Logger logger = LogManager.
    getLogger(CH18Example5.class);
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        double cpuUsage = 80.0;
        double memoryUsage = 90.0;
        double responseTime = 600;
        if (isAnomalous(cpuUsage, memoryUsage, responseTime)) {
            logger.warn("Anomalous activity detected: CPU Usage: 
            {}, Memory Usage: {}, Response Time: {}", cpuUsage, 
            memoryUsage, responseTime);
        } else {
            logger.info("System operating normally.");
        }
    }
    private static boolean isAnomalous(double cpuUsage, double 
    memoryUsage, double responseTime) {
        return cpuUsage &gt; 75.0 &amp;&amp; memoryUsage &gt; 85.0 &amp;&amp; responseTime &gt; 
        500;
    }
}</pre>			<p>As you can see in the preceding example, the implementation is simplistic and results in notifications and warnings. It’s noteworthy that this is simply provided for illustration purposes. In a full implementation, a pre-trained ML model would be incorporated to detect what is anomalous<a id="_idIndexMarker1027"/> and what <span class="No-Break">is not.</span></p>
			<p>Let’s end this section with an exploration of maintenance strategies with predictive <span class="No-Break">maintenance models.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-360"><a id="_idTextAnchor359"/>Maintenance strategies</h2>
			<p>AI technology includes<a id="_idIndexMarker1028"/> the ability for us to train models to predict maintenance. This model could be used to anticipate hardware and software failures long before they occur. When we are notified of the predictions, we can be proactive with our hardware and <span class="No-Break">software maintenance.</span></p>
			<p>Let’s look at a simple program that uses AI to conduct predictive <span class="No-Break">maintenance concerns:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
import weka.classifiers.Classifier;
import weka.core.Instances;
import weka.core.converters.ConverterUtils.DataSource;
public class CH18Example6 {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        DataSource source = new DataSource("path/my_maintenance_data.
        arff");
        Instances data = source.getDataSet();
        data.setClassIndex(data.numAttributes() - 1);
        Classifier classifier = (Classifier) weka.core.
        SerializationHelper.read("path/my_maintenance_model.model");
        double prediction = classifier.classifyInstance(data.
        instance(0));
        if (prediction == 1.0) {
            System.out.println("Predictive Maintenance System Report 
            (PMSR): Maintenance required soon.");
        } else {
            System.out.println(" Predictive Maintenance System Report 
            (PMSR): System is operating normally.");
        }
    }
}</pre>			<p>Our example uses an ML model to predict whether maintenance is required. This is based on analysis of <span class="No-Break">historical data.</span></p>
			<p>As detailed in this section, AI can power<a id="_idIndexMarker1029"/> our anomaly detection, automate our monitoring, enhance our logging and alerting systems, and predict when hardware and software maintenance is required. In the next section, we will briefly explore how we can integrate our Java applications with AI services <span class="No-Break">and platforms.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-361"><a id="_idTextAnchor360"/>AI integration</h1>
			<p>AI requires significant<a id="_idIndexMarker1030"/> computing power. Leveraging the elastic cloud computing of cloud service providers is commonplace. There are also open source platforms that offer pre-built models for use. Let’s take a brief look at AI services from the three largest cloud service providers (AWS, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud) and two open source platforms (Apache Spark MLlib and TensorFlow for Java), starting with the three cloud <span class="No-Break">service providers.</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">AWS AI Services</strong>: Amazon’s cloud<a id="_idIndexMarker1031"/> platform offers<a id="_idIndexMarker1032"/> an entire suite<a id="_idIndexMarker1033"/> of AI services that include <strong class="bold">SageMaker</strong> for building training models, <strong class="bold">Amazon Rekognition</strong> for image and video<a id="_idIndexMarker1034"/> analysis, and <strong class="bold">Amazon Comprehend</strong> <span class="No-Break">for NLP.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Microsoft Azure AI</strong>: Microsoft offers similar AI<a id="_idIndexMarker1035"/> tools<a id="_idIndexMarker1036"/> to AWS, which include <strong class="bold">Azure ML</strong> for ML model development, <strong class="bold">Bot Service</strong> for creating<a id="_idIndexMarker1037"/> AI-powered chatbots, and <strong class="bold">Cognitive Services</strong>, containing pre-built<a id="_idIndexMarker1038"/> <span class="No-Break">AI functionality.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Google Cloud AI</strong>: Google Cloud, like Amazon<a id="_idIndexMarker1039"/> and Microsoft, offers a suite of AI tools. These include <strong class="bold">AutoML</strong>, which can<a id="_idIndexMarker1040"/> be used for<a id="_idIndexMarker1041"/> custom model training, <strong class="bold">Vision AI</strong> for image<a id="_idIndexMarker1042"/> recognition, and <strong class="bold">Natural Language API</strong> for <span class="No-Break">text analysis.</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>Now let’s review two open source <span class="No-Break">AI platforms:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Apache Spark MLlib</strong>: This is a scalable ML library<a id="_idIndexMarker1043"/> that is, as the name suggests, an add-on to Apache Spark. This library includes many algorithms that can be used for classification, clustering, collaborative filtering, and regression. These are all ripe for use with <span class="No-Break">Java applications.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">TensorFlow</strong>: This is an open source library<a id="_idIndexMarker1044"/> that focuses on numeric computation and ML. One of the great things about this library is that it provides <strong class="bold">Java bindings</strong> that enable us to use ML capabilities<a id="_idIndexMarker1045"/> in our <span class="No-Break">Java applications.</span></li>

			<p>Let’s look at best practices for integrating AI services into our <span class="No-Break">Java applications.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-362"><a id="_idTextAnchor361"/>Best practices</h2>
			<p>Integrating AI services<a id="_idIndexMarker1046"/> from one of the cloud service providers or an open source platform can seem daunting. The service providers have a plethora of documentation to aid in the implementation. Regardless of which platform or library you implement, the following best <span class="No-Break">practices apply:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li>Clearly define the problem you want to solve with AI. This clarity will help ensure that your implementation is efficient <span class="No-Break">and purposeful.</span></li>
				<li>Ensure that the data you use to train your ML modes is clean and of high quality. The better your data is (that is, the more optimized its, quality, accuracy, and organization are), the more easily your ML models can learn <span class="No-Break">from it.</span></li>
				<li>Optimize the performance of your AI operations. As previously stated, AI operations are computationally heavy, so optimization <span class="No-Break">is critical.</span></li>
				<li>Just like other sophisticated software, AI services can fail (that is, produce unexpected results or crash), so be sure to incorporate robust error and <span class="No-Break">exception handling.</span></li>
				<li>Be sure to continuously monitor the performance of your AI methods and modules. Maintain<a id="_idIndexMarker1047"/> the code so that it <span class="No-Break">remains optimized.</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>Next, we will review ethical and practical considerations regarding using AI in <span class="No-Break">software development.</span></p>
