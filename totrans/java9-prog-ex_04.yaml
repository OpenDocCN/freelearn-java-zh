    game for two players. Player one selects four differently colored pins out of
    six possible colors and arranges them on a board in a row hidden from the other
    player. The other player tries to guess the colors of the pins and its positions.
    After each try, player one tells the number of matching colors and the pins matching
    both color and position. The program will act as both player one and player two.
    Our code will play alone. However, what remains for us to play with is the most
    important: the code.'

    pins of six different colors that can be inserted into the holes. Each pin has
    one color. They are usually red, green, blue, yellow, black, and white. There
    is a special row that is hidden from one of the players (the guesser).

    the real world and map real-world objects to objects in the program. You certainly
    have heard of object orientation explained with the very typical examples of geometric
    objects, or the car and the motor thing to explain composition. Personally, I
    believe that these examples are too simple to get a good understanding. They may
    be good for starters, but we are already in the fourth chapter of the book. The
    Mastermind game is much better. It is a bit more complex than just rectangles

    power plant control.

    and nothing else. This way, we can eliminate the pin class from our model early
    on, even before we created it in Java. Instead, we have colors.

    `a == b` or you can use the `equals` method inherited from the `Object` class,
    `a.equals(b)`. It is tempting to encode the colors with letters, or use `String`
    constants to denote them. It may be easier first, but there are serious drawbacks
    later. When the code becomes complex, it leads to bugs; it will be easy to pass
    something also encoded as String instead of a color and only unit tests may save
    the day. Better, the compiler already complains in the IDE when you type the wrong
    argument.

    boxes. How do we get the colors in the program? We need something from where we
    can fetch colors or looking at the other way something that can give us colors.
    We will call it `ColorManager`. `ColorManager` knows how many different colors
    we have and any time we need a color, we can ask for it.
  prefs: []

    a color by its serial number. If we have four colors, we could ask for color number
    0, 1, 2, or 3\. But then again, it would just implicitly encode the colors as
    integer numbers, which we agreed we will not. We should find the minimum feature
    that we will need to model the game.

    good as any other. Later, the guesses should consider the responses that were
    given for previous guesses. It is a reasonable approach to try only color variations
    that can be the actual secret. The player selects a variation and looks at all
    previous guesses assuming that the selected variation is the secret. If the responses
    to the rows he has already made are the same for this variation as for the unknown
    secret in the game, then it is reasonable to try this variation. If there is any
    difference in the responses, then this variation is certainly not the variation
    that was hidden.
  prefs: []

    one after the other and compare it against the table. The guesser code will not
    create and store all the possible variations ahead, but it has to know where it
    was and has to be able to calculate the next variation that comes. This assumes
    an order of the variations. For a short while, let's forget that no color may
    appear twice in a variation. A simple ordering can be made the same way as we
    sort decimal numbers. If we have a three-digit number, then the first one is 000,
    the next one is 001, and so on until 009, always fetching the next digit for the
    last position. After that, 010 comes. We increased a digit next to the last one
    and we set the last one to 0 again. Now, we have 011, 012, and so on. You know,
    how we count numbers. Now, replace the digits with colors and we have only six
    and not ten. Or, we have as many as we want when we instantiate a `ColorManager`

    the type of the variable as an interface, but the value is an instance of a class.
    Obviously, the value cannot be an instance of an interface because such beasts
    do not exist. But, why do we define the variable to be an interface? The reason
    is abstraction and coding practice. If we need to change the implementation we
    use for some reason, the variable type still may remain the same and there is
    no need to change the code elsewhere. It is also a good practice to declare the
    variable to be an interface so that we will not have the temptation to use some
    special API of the implementation that is not available in the interface just
    by convenience. When it is really needed, we can change the type of the variable
    and use the special API. After all, there is a reason that API is there, but the
    mere temptation to use some special thing just because it is there is hindered.

    at your class. You can store the names on small papers in envelopes one for each
    starting letter. Instead of searching through the 10 thousand students, you can
    look at the papers in the envelope titled W. This very simple hash function assigns
    the first letter of the name to the name (or the ordinal number of the letter,
    as we said that a hash function results a number). This is not really a good hash
    function because it puts only a few elements, if any, into the envelope denoted
    X and many to A for example.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A good hash function results each possible ordinal number with similar probability.
    In hash tables, we usually have more buckets (envelopes in the previous example)
    than the number of elements to be stored. Therefore, when an element is searched
    for, it is likely that there is only one element there. At least that is what
    we would like to have. If there are multiple elements in a single bucket, it is
    called collision. A good hash function has as little collisions as possible.
  prefs: []

    was introduced in version 1.2 only. `Hashtable` has many drawbacks and its use
    is not recommended. (Even the name is violating the Java naming conventions.)
    We do not discuss this class in this book. Whenever we talk about hash tables,
    it is referring to the actual array that is inside the implementation of `HashSet`,
    `HashMap`, or any other collection that uses some hash indexed table.

    take considerable time and, during this, the individual elements are moved between
    the buckets.

    method and does not return until it is finished. Single thread code has no possibility
    to use the hash table during this period: the one and single thread is executing

    wired into the code. We cannot send the output somewhere else unless we change
    the code. This is not too flexible and in many cases we need a solution that can
    work with different output, different color manager or different whatever service
    our code depends on. The first step to do that is to have a field that has a reference
    of the object that gives our class the service. In case of output the type of
    the field can be of type `OutputStream`. The next, more interesting step is how
    this field gets value.

    can be expressed in a declarative fashion that describes which service object
    needs which other service objects and also what implementation of the service
    interfaces are to be used. Dependency injection injectors work with such declarative
    descriptions. When there is a need for an object that needs service objects that
    themselves need again other service objects the injector creates the service instances
    in the appropriate order using the implementations that are matching the declarative
    descriptions. The injector discovers all the dependencies transitively and creates

    that we will examine a bit. Let's reiterate that Java passes arguments by value.
    It means that when you pass an array to a method, you will pass the value of the
    variable that holds the array. However, an array in Java is an Object just as
    well as anything else (except primitives like `int`). Therefore, what the variable
    contains is a reference to an object that happens to be an array. If you change
    the elements of the array, you actually change the elements of the original array.
    The array reference is copied when the argument passes, but the array itself,
    and the elements, are not.

- en: The `java.util.Arrays` utility class provides a lot of useful tools. We can
    easily code the array copying in Java but why to reinvent the wheel? In addition
    to that, arrays are continuous area of memory that can very effectively be copied
    from one place to another using low-level machine code. The `copyOf` method that
    we invoke calls the method `System.arraycopy` which is a native method and as
    such executes native code.

    any of the objects that are stored in the array (not the reference in the array,

    is modified. `Arrays.copyOf` does not copy the objects that are referenced by

    the two `int` values. We do not create two setters for the two values, however,

    values are consistent. The sum of the two values cannot be more than the number
    of the columns. This check ensures that the caller, who uses the API of the `Row`
    class, does not use it inconsistently. If this API is used only from inside our
    code, this assertion should not be part of the code. A good coding style, in that
    case, will ensure that the method is never invoked inconsistently using unit tests.
    When we create API to use out of our control, we should check that the use is
    consistent. Failing to do so, our code may behave just weird when used inconsistently.
    When the caller sets matches to values that do not match any possible guess, the
    game may never finish and the caller may have a hard time figuring out what is
    going on. This figuring out probably will need the debug execution of our code.

    for the functionalities implemented in the classes of this chapter as well. We
    will just not print these unit tests here. Instead of listing the unit tests,
    we will look at an integration test.

- en: Integration tests need the invocation of many classes working together. They
    check that the functionality can be delivered by the whole application, or at
    least a larger part of the application, and do not focus on a single unit. They
    are called integration tests because they test the integration between classes.
    The classes alone are all OK. They should not have any problem as it was already
    verified by the unit tests. Integration focuses on how they work together.

- en: If we want to test the `Game` class, we will either have to create mocks that
    mimic the behavior of the other `Game` classes, or we will just write an integration
    test. Technically, an integration test is very similar to a unit test. Many times,
    the very same JUnit framework is used to execute the integration tests. This is
    the case for the integration test of this game.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The build tool, however, needs to be configured to execute the integration tests
    only when it is required. Usually, integration test executions need more time,
    and sometimes resources, such as external database that may not be available at
    each and every developer desktop. Unit tests run every time the application is
    compiled so they have to be fast. To separate the unit and integration tests,
    there are different techniques and configuration options, but there is no such
    more or less de-facto standard like the directory structure introduced by Maven
    (later adapted by Gradle).

- en: In our case, the integration test does not need any extra resource and does
    not take enormous time to run. It plays a game from the start to the end and plays
    the role of both the players. It is very much like somebody playing chess with
    themselves, making a step and then turning the table.

- en: The aim of this code is twofold. On one hand, we want to see that the code runs
    and plays a whole game. If the game finishes, then it is just OK. This is a very
    weak assertion and real integration tests perform lots of assertions (one test
    tests only one assertion though). We will focus on the other aim—deliver some
    joy and visualize the game on the console in text format so that the reader does
    not get bored.

- en: To do that, we will create a utility class that prints out a color and assigns
    letters to the `Color` instances on the fly. This is the `PrettyPrintRow` class.
    There are several limitations in this class that we have to talk about after we
    look at the code. I'd say that this code is here only to demonstrate what not
    to do, to establish some reasoning for the next chapter, and why we need to refactor
    the code we created in this one.

- en: This is the heart of this class. When a color is to be printed, it gets a letter
    assigned unless it already has one. As the `Map` containing the assignments in
    each and every game that is running in the JVM will use the same mapping, a new
    `Game` is started. It allocates new `Color`s and will soon run out of the six
    characters that we allocated here in the `String` constant.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If the `Game` instances are run parallel, then we are in even more trouble.
    The class is not thread safe at all. If two threads concurrently call the `colorToChar`
    method for the same `Color` instance, (which is not likely because each `Game`
    uses its own color, but note that *not likely* in programming is very much like
    a famous last words quote on a tombstone) then both threads may see at the same
    time that there is no letter assigned to the color and both will assign the letter
    (the same letter or two different letters, based on luck) and increase the counter
    once or twice. At least, what we can say is that the execution is nondeterministic.

    to find bug after multithread issues. Such a nondeterministic code is exactly
    that: a multithread issue. There is no prize to find the most difficult bug. When
    the application does not run, and a bug affects the production system for hours
    or days, no businessperson will be happy, and they will not be amazed after you
    find the bug. It may be an intellectual challenge, but the real value is not creating
    the bugs in the first place.'

    this chapter, it is good, though a smelly and shameful code, but it will be a
    good example for the next chapter, in which we will see, how to refactor the application
    so that it will not need such a hacking to print out the colors.

- en: Code smell is a term minted by Kent Back, according to Martin Fowler ([http://martinfowler.com/bliki/CodeSmell.html](http://martinfowler.com/bliki/CodeSmell.html)).
    It means that some code looks not good, nor apparently bad, but some constructs
    make the feeling in the developer that it may not be good. As it is defined on
    the web page, *"A code smell is a surface indication that usually corresponds
    to a deeper problem in the system."* The term is widely accepted and used in software
    development for the last 10 years.

    any assertions other than it runs without exception), defines six colors and four
    columns. This is the size of the original game. It creates a color manager, and
    then it creates a table and a secret. The secret could be just any random color
    selection from the six colors that is available (there are 360 different possibilities
    tested in the `UniqueGuesserTest` unit test available from GitHub). As we know
    that the `Guesser` implementation starts from one end of the color set and creates
    the new guesses systematically, we want to set a secret that it will guess the
    last. This is not because we are evil, but rather because we want to see that
    our code really works.
