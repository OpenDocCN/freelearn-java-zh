<p><a href="45a65572-53a1-42bd-aa7a-d1437e65a58f.xhtml" target="_blank">Chapter 1</a>, <em>Journey to the Spring World</em><span>, will guide you through the main concepts of Spring Framework. Here we learn to setup the environment by installing OpenJDK, Maven, IntelliJ IDEA, and Docker. By the end, we will create our first Spring application.</span></p>
<p><a href="8b857b24-87be-4066-acb3-daa9a596b61e.xhtml" target="_blank">Chapter 2</a>, <em>Starting in the Spring World – the CMS Application</em><span>, will begin by getting our hands dirty with Spring Initializr to create configurations for our CMS application. We will then learn how to create REST resources, add the service layer and finally integrate with AngularJS.</span></p>
<p><a href="827e9516-ff3d-44d7-8a16-95579684f453.xhtml" target="_blank">Chapter 3</a>, <em>Persistence with Spring Data and Reactive Fashion</em><span>, will build upon our CMS application created in the previous chapter. Here we will learn how to persist data on a real database by learning about Spring Data Reactive MongoDB and PostgresSQL. We will finally learn about Project Reactor which will help you to create a non-blocking application in the JVM ecosystem.</span></p>
<p><a href="4286f9d7-1fe5-49c7-9201-49f9c9bdddf6.xhtml" target="_blank">Chapter 4</a>, <em>Kotlin Basics and Spring Data Redis</em><span>, will give you a basic introduction to Kotlin while presenting the benefits of the language. We will then learn how to use Redis which will be used as a message broker using the publish-subscribe feature.</span></p>
<p><a href="eb1d7de5-c93b-49c2-a1a5-2c5e8b65cddc.xhtml" target="_blank">Chapter 5</a>, <em>Reactive Web Clients</em><span>, will teach you how to use the Spring Reactive Web Client and make HTTP calls in a reactive fashion. We will also be introduced to RabbitMQ and Spring Actuator.</span></p>
<p><a href="b82dbdb2-c96b-466f-aa29-2e2c40a69d3c.xhtml" target="_blank">Chapter 6</a>, <em>Playing with Server-Sent Events</em><span>, will help you develop an application which will filter tweets by text content. We will accomplish this by consuming the tweeter steam using Server-Sent Events which is a standard way to send data streams from a server to clients</span></p>
<p><a href="136fa6be-c92d-415a-8b97-d0b04aea3f7f.xhtml" target="_blank">Chapter 7</a>, <em>Airline Ticket System</em><span>, will teach you to use Spring Messaging, WebFlux, and Spring Data components to build a airline ticket system. You will also learn about circuit breakers and OAuth in this chapter. By the end, we will create a system with many microservices to ensure scalability.</span></p>
<p><a href="02944733-f452-49bc-bb4f-f4fa819c2405.xhtml" target="_blank">Chapter 8</a>, <em>Circuit Breakers and Security</em><span>, will help you discover how to apply service discovery features for our business microservices while also understanding how the Circuit Breaker pattern can help us to bring resilience to our applications. </span></p>
<p><a href="758c4245-cac6-4bcd-9e47-5b2dc6973013.xhtml" target="_blank">Chapter 9</a>, <em>Putting It All Together</em><span>, will bring the entire book into perspective while also teaching you about the Turbine server. We will also look into the Hystrix Dashboard to monitor our different microservices to ensure maintainability and optimum performance of our applications.</span></p>

                    <h1 class="header-title">Conventions used</h1>

            <article>
                
<p>There are a number of text conventions used throughout this book.</p>
<p><kbd>CodeInText</kbd>: <span>Indicates c</span>ode words in text, database table names, folder names, filenames, file extensions, pathnames, dummy URLs, user input, and Twitter handles. <span>Here is an example:</span> "<span>It includes the infrastructure connections which are configured in the default profile in </span><kbd>application.yaml</kbd><span>.</span>"</p>
<p>A block of code is set as follows:</p>
<pre>&lt;dependency&gt;<br/>  &lt;groupId&gt;org.springframework.boot&lt;/groupId&gt;<br/>  &lt;artifactId&gt;spring-boot-starter-amqp&lt;/artifactId&gt;<br/>&lt;/dependency&gt;</pre>
<p>When we wish to draw your attention to a particular part of a code block, the relevant lines or items are set in bold:</p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<pre style="padding-left: 30px"><span>management:<br/></span><span>  endpoints:<br/></span><span>    web:<br/></span><strong>      expose: "*"</strong></pre>
<p>Any command-line input or output is written as follows:</p>
<pre><strong>docker-compose up -d</strong></pre>
<p><strong>Bold</strong>: Indicates a new term, an important word, or w<span>ords that you see onscreen. For example, words in menus or dialog boxes appear in the text like this. Here is an example: "The next screen will be shown and we can configure the <span class="packt_screen">Environment Variable</span>:</span><span>"</span></p>
<div class="packt_infobox">Warnings or important notes appear like this.</div>
<div class="packt_tip">Tips and tricks appear like this.</div>
