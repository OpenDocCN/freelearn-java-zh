			<h1 id="_idParaDest-88"><a id="_idTextAnchor088"/>Conditional Statements</h1>
			<p>In <a href="B19793_03.xhtml#_idTextAnchor067"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 3</em></span></a>, we learned about Java operators. We discussed two important properties of operators, namely, precedence and associativity. Precedence helps group shared operands. When precedence levels match, associativity is then used <span class="No-Break">for grouping.</span></p>
			<p>We discussed the unary operators – prefix and postfix increment/decrement, cast, and logical NOT. We also covered the binary operators – arithmetic, relational, logical, bitwise, and compound assignment. We learned about the behavior of the <strong class="source-inline">+</strong> symbol when one (or both) operands is a string. We discussed the logical AND (<strong class="source-inline">&amp;&amp;</strong>) and logical OR (<strong class="source-inline">||</strong>) and their short-circuiting property. Finally, the ternary operator, with its three operands, <span class="No-Break">was covered.</span></p>
			<p>We also learned about Java casting. This can <a id="_idIndexMarker263"/>be done implicitly, known as <strong class="bold">implicit promotion</strong> or <strong class="bold">widening</strong>. The <a id="_idIndexMarker264"/>other alternative is explicit <a id="_idIndexMarker265"/>casting, known as <strong class="bold">narrowing</strong>. When narrowing, we must cast to the target type in order to remove the compiler error. Lastly, we discussed compile-time constants, which, because their values never change, enable the compiler to apply <span class="No-Break">different rules.</span></p>
			<p>Now that we know about operators, let us do something interesting with them. By the end of this chapter, you will be able to use Java’s operators to create conditional statements. Conditional statements enable us to make decisions. In addition, you will understand a fundamental concept in Java, <span class="No-Break">namely, scope.</span></p>
			<p>In this chapter, we are going to cover the following <span class="No-Break">main topics:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><span class="No-Break">Understanding scope</span></li>
				<li>Exploring <span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">if</strong></span><span class="No-Break"> statements</span></li>
				<li>Mastering <strong class="source-inline">switch</strong> statements <span class="No-Break">and expressions</span></li>

			<h1 id="_idParaDest-90"><a id="_idTextAnchor090"/>Understanding scope</h1>
			<p>In programming, scope <a id="_idIndexMarker266"/>defines where a variable is/is not usable within a program. This is often referred to as the visibility of the variable. In other words, where in the code is the variable “visible”. Java uses <strong class="bold">block scope</strong>. In order <a id="_idIndexMarker267"/>to explain Java’s scope, we must first understand what a <span class="No-Break">block is.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-91"><a id="_idTextAnchor091"/>What is a block?</h2>
			<p>Curly braces delimit <a id="_idIndexMarker268"/>a block of code. In other words, a block starts with the opening curly brace, <strong class="source-inline">{</strong>, and ends with the closing curly brace, <strong class="source-inline">}</strong>. Note that the braces face each other, as in <strong class="source-inline">{ }</strong>. A variable is visible and available for use, from where it is declared in the block, to the closing <strong class="source-inline">}</strong> of that block. <span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Figure 4</em></span><em class="italic">.1</em> presents a code example to <span class="No-Break">help explain:</span></p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer038" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B19793_04_1.jpg" alt="Figure 4.1 – Block scope in Java"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 4.1 – Block scope in Java</p>
			<p>In the preceding figure, we declare an <strong class="source-inline">int</strong> variable, <strong class="source-inline">x</strong>, on line 5 and initialize it to <strong class="source-inline">1</strong>. The current block of code is the group of Java statements surrounded by <strong class="source-inline">{ }</strong>. Therefore, the <strong class="source-inline">x</strong> variable’s block of code starts on line 4, where the opening curly brace is, and ends on line 15, where the closing curly brace is. Thus, the scope of <strong class="source-inline">x</strong> is from line 5, where it is declared, to line 15 (the closing curly brace of the current scope). When we refer to <strong class="source-inline">x</strong> on line 6, there is no issue, as <strong class="source-inline">x</strong> is <span class="No-Break">in scope.</span></p>
			<p>On line 8, we start <a id="_idIndexMarker269"/>a new block/scope with <strong class="source-inline">{</strong>. Though somewhat unusual, as there is no code preceding <strong class="source-inline">{</strong> on line 8, lines 8 to 12 define a valid code block. Note that variables from the outer scope are visible within this inner (nested) scope. This is shown on line 11 where, in the inner scope, we refer to a variable declared in the outer scope, namely <strong class="source-inline">x</strong>, without <span class="No-Break">any issue.</span></p>
			<p>The inverse is not true, however; a variable defined in an inner scope is not visible in the outer scope. The <strong class="source-inline">y</strong> variable is in scope from where it is declared (line 9 of the inner scope) to line 12 (the closing curly brace of that scope). Thus, we get a compiler error on line 14 where, in the outer scope, we refer to the <span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">y</strong></span><span class="No-Break"> variable.</span></p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Indentation</p>
			<p class="callout">Indentation really helps with the identification of code blocks and, consequently, scopes. The style we use is to start the code block at the end of the line. For example, in <span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Figure 4</em></span><em class="italic">.1</em>, note the opening curly brace <strong class="source-inline">{</strong> on line 3. The closing curly brace <strong class="source-inline">}</strong> for that code block (and thus the scope) is on line 16. From an indentation point of view, the closing curly brace <strong class="source-inline">}</strong> is directly under the <strong class="source-inline">public</strong> keyword from line 3. More specifically, the closing curly brace is directly under the ‘p’ in <strong class="source-inline">public</strong>. While not necessary for compilation, it does make your code easier to read and maintain – the scope starts on line 3 and to find where the scope ends, one just scans down the program to find the matching curly brace <strong class="source-inline">}</strong> which lines up under <strong class="source-inline">public</strong> (from <span class="No-Break">line 3).</span></p>
			<p class="callout">Line 4 also defines a block and thus a scope. Line 15 contains the matching curly brace <strong class="source-inline">}</strong> for that scope – note that the closing curly brace is lined up under the keyword <strong class="source-inline">public</strong> (from line 4). Thankfully, the editors are a great help in keeping your code <span class="No-Break">properly indented.</span></p>
			<p>In summary, blocks are defined with <strong class="source-inline">{ }</strong>. As Java uses block scope, the code blocks define the scope of <a id="_idIndexMarker270"/>where a variable can be used. Variables are visible in nested scopes, but not <span class="No-Break">vice versa.</span></p>
			<p>Now that we understand scope in Java, let us examine conditional logic in Java. We will start with <span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">if</strong></span><span class="No-Break"> statements.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-92"><a id="_idTextAnchor092"/>Exploring if statements</h1>
			<p>As their name suggests, conditional statements are based on the evaluation of a condition. The result <a id="_idIndexMarker271"/>of this condition is either <strong class="source-inline">true </strong>or <strong class="source-inline">false </strong>– in other words, a boolean. <span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Figure 4</em></span><em class="italic">.2</em> introduces the syntax of the overall <span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">if</strong></span><span class="No-Break"> statement:</span></p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer039" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B19793_04_2.jpg" alt="Figure 4.2 – The if statement syntax"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 4.2 – The if statement syntax</p>
			<p>The square brackets <strong class="source-inline">[]</strong> in the preceding figure denote something as optional. For example, both the <strong class="source-inline">else if</strong> statements and the <strong class="source-inline">else</strong> statement are optional. The <strong class="source-inline">if</strong> statement itself is mandatory. The three ellipses, <strong class="source-inline">...</strong>, indicate that you can have as many <strong class="source-inline">else if</strong> statements as you like (or none <span class="No-Break">at all).</span></p>
			<p>Now that we have the overall syntax, let us break it down into <span class="No-Break">smaller pieces.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-93"><a id="_idTextAnchor093"/>The if statement itself</h2>
			<p>As stated earlier, an <strong class="source-inline">if</strong> statement evaluates a <strong class="source-inline">boolean</strong> expression. This <strong class="source-inline">boolean</strong> expression <a id="_idIndexMarker272"/>is enclosed in parentheses. Curly braces that delimit a block of code are optional if there is only one statement after the <strong class="source-inline">if</strong> clause. However, it is considered good practice to always explicitly declare a block of code. <span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Figure 4</em></span><em class="italic">.3</em> demonstrates <span class="No-Break">both styles:</span></p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer040" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B19793_04_3.jpg" alt="Figure 4.3 – Simple if statements"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 4.3 – Simple if statements</p>
			<p>First, let us <a id="_idIndexMarker273"/>explain the code. Note the indentation, which is automatically facilitated by the code editors. This makes it easier to see the statements that are governed by the various <strong class="source-inline">if</strong> statements. Both lines 9 and 11 demonstrate simple <strong class="source-inline">if</strong> statements that control just one statement. Line 9 controls line 10. This means that if line 9 is true, line 10 is executed. If line 9 is false then line 10 is skipped. Similarly, if line 11 is true: line 12 is executed; if line 11 is false, line 12 <span class="No-Break">is skipped.</span></p>
			<p>However, if you wish to execute two or more statements when an <strong class="source-inline">if</strong> statement is true, a code block is required. This is demonstrated by lines 13 to 16. If the boolean expression on line 13 evaluates to true, then both of the statements on lines 14 and 15 will be executed. This is because they are in a <span class="No-Break">code block.</span></p>
			<p>As regards the running program, with <strong class="source-inline">x</strong> initialized to <strong class="source-inline">5</strong> and <strong class="source-inline">y</strong> to <strong class="source-inline">4</strong>, when line 9 executes, it is true (as <strong class="source-inline">5 &gt; 4</strong>). Therefore, line 10 executes and therefore the output from <span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Figure 4</em></span><em class="italic">.3</em> is <strong class="source-inline">5 &gt; 4</strong>. Lines 11 and 13 are both executed but as they both evaluate to false, nothing else is output to <span class="No-Break">the screen.</span></p>
			<p>What if, on line 8, we initialized the variables <span class="No-Break">as follows:</span></p>
			<p><strong class="source-inline">int </strong><span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">x=4, y=5;</strong></span></p>
			<p>Now, <strong class="source-inline">if(x &gt; y)</strong> is false and line 10 is not executed; <strong class="source-inline">if(x &lt; y)</strong> is true and line 12 outputs <strong class="source-inline">4 &lt; 5</strong> to the screen; <strong class="source-inline">if(x == y)</strong> is also false, so lines 14 and 15 are <span class="No-Break">not executed.</span></p>
			<p>Lastly, let us make the variables equal by changing line 8 <span class="No-Break">as follows:</span></p>
			<p><strong class="source-inline">int </strong><span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">x=4, y=4;</strong></span></p>
			<p>Now, <strong class="source-inline">if(x &gt; y)</strong> is false so line 10 is not executed; <strong class="source-inline">if(x &lt; y)</strong> is also false so line 12 is not executed; however, <strong class="source-inline">if(x == y)</strong> is true, so line 14 builds up the string <strong class="source-inline">s</strong> to be “4 == 4” and line 15 <span class="No-Break">outputs it.</span></p>
			<p>Note the indentation, which is automatically <a id="_idIndexMarker274"/>facilitated by the code editors. This makes it easier to see the statements that are governed by the various <span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">if</strong></span><span class="No-Break"> statements.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-94"><a id="_idTextAnchor094"/>else if statements</h2>
			<p>In <span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Figure 4</em></span><em class="italic">.3</em>, there is <a id="_idIndexMarker275"/>no code to cater to the situations where an <strong class="source-inline">if</strong> expression evaluates to false. This is where the <strong class="source-inline">else if</strong> statement comes in. <span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Figure 4</em></span><em class="italic">.4</em> shows an <strong class="source-inline">else if</strong> <span class="No-Break">in code:</span></p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer041" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B19793_04_4.jpg" alt="Figure 4.4 – else if statements"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 4.4 – else if statements</p>
			<p>As <strong class="source-inline">x</strong> is 4 and <strong class="source-inline">y</strong> is 5 (line 19), the <strong class="source-inline">if</strong> expression on line 20 evaluates to false and thus control jumps to line 22 where the first <strong class="source-inline">else</strong> <strong class="source-inline">if</strong> is evaluated. As this evaluates to true, line 23 is executed. <em class="italic">Now, no other branch will be evaluated</em>. In other words, the next line of code executed after line 23 is line 27. Note that, as per good coding practice, each branch is coded as a block, even though there is only one statement in <span class="No-Break">each block.</span></p>
			<p>Had <strong class="source-inline">x</strong> been initialized to <strong class="source-inline">5</strong>, then lines 20 and 22 would both have evaluated to false. Line 24 would <a id="_idIndexMarker276"/>be true, and thus, line 25 would <span class="No-Break">be executed.</span></p>
			<p>For situations where the <strong class="source-inline">if</strong> and <strong class="source-inline">else if</strong> statements do not match, we can use the <strong class="source-inline">else</strong> statement. Let us discuss <span class="No-Break">that now.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-95"><a id="_idTextAnchor095"/>else statements</h2>
			<p>The code in <span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Figure 4</em></span><em class="italic">.4</em> evaluates all possible scenarios when comparing <strong class="source-inline">x</strong> and <strong class="source-inline">y</strong>. Either <strong class="source-inline">x</strong> is greater <a id="_idIndexMarker277"/>than, less than, or equal to <strong class="source-inline">y</strong>. This logic lends itself nicely to introducing the <strong class="source-inline">else</strong> statement. The <strong class="source-inline">else</strong> statement is a <em class="italic">catch-all</em>. As per <strong class="source-inline">[]</strong> in <span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Figure 4</em></span><em class="italic">.2</em>, the <strong class="source-inline">else</strong> clause is optional. If present, it must be coded at the end after any <strong class="source-inline">if</strong> and/or <strong class="source-inline">else if</strong> clauses. <span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Figure 4</em></span><em class="italic">.5</em> is <span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Figure 4</em></span><em class="italic">.4</em> refactored using an <strong class="source-inline">else</strong> clause, except that the values of <strong class="source-inline">x</strong> and <strong class="source-inline">y</strong> in <span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Figure 4</em></span><em class="italic">.5</em> are now <span class="No-Break">the same.</span></p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer042" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B19793_04_5.jpg" alt="Figure 4.5 – else statement"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 4.5 – else statement</p>
			<p>In <span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Figure 4</em></span><em class="italic">.5</em>, as both <strong class="source-inline">x</strong> and <strong class="source-inline">y</strong> are <strong class="source-inline">4</strong>, lines 31 and 33 evaluate to <strong class="source-inline">false</strong>. However, there is no condition on line 35 as it is simply an <strong class="source-inline">else</strong> statement (as opposed to <strong class="source-inline">else if</strong>). This means that the code block beginning on line 35 is executed automatically and line 36 <span class="No-Break">is executed.</span></p>
			<p>With regard to <strong class="source-inline">if else</strong> statements, it is important to understand a subtle problem that can arise known as the “dangling <span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">else</strong></span><span class="No-Break">” problem.</span></p>
			<h3>Dangling else</h3>
			<p>Consider the <a id="_idIndexMarker278"/>following unindented code, which uses no <span class="No-Break">code blocks:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
boolean flag=false;                // line 1if (flag)                          // line 2
if (flag)                          // line 3
System .out.println("True True");  // line 4
else                               // line 5
System.out.println("True False");  // line 6</pre>
			<p>This code has <a id="_idIndexMarker279"/>two <strong class="source-inline">if</strong> statements but only one <strong class="source-inline">else</strong> statement. Which <strong class="source-inline">if</strong> statement does <strong class="source-inline">else</strong> match with? The rule is: when an <strong class="source-inline">else</strong> statement is looking to match with <strong class="source-inline">if</strong>, it will match with the nearest <em class="italic">unmatched</em> <strong class="source-inline">if</strong> as it progresses back up through <span class="No-Break">the code.</span></p>
			<p>Following <a id="_idIndexMarker280"/>this rule, the <strong class="source-inline">else</strong> statement matches with the second <strong class="source-inline">if</strong> (line 3) as that <strong class="source-inline">if</strong> statement has not yet been matched. This means that the <strong class="source-inline">if</strong> statement on line 2 remains unmatched. The code, when written using proper indentation, is <span class="No-Break">much clearer:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
if (flag)                    // line 2    if (flag)                // line 3
        System.out.println("True True");     // line 4
    else                    // line 5
        System.out.println("True False");    // line 6</pre>
			<p>This is confirmed by the output. If <strong class="source-inline">flag</strong> is true, the output is <strong class="source-inline">"True True"</strong>; if <strong class="source-inline">flag</strong> is false, however, nothing is output to the screen. Interestingly, there is no way line 6 can now be reached (as <strong class="source-inline">boolean</strong> variables have only two values: <strong class="source-inline">true </strong><span class="No-Break">and </span><span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">false</strong></span><span class="No-Break">).</span></p>
			<p>Using code blocks makes the code even easier to understand, as can be seen <span class="No-Break">as follows:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
if (flag) {    if (flag) {
        System.out.println("True True");
    }
    else {
        System.out.println("True False");
    }
}</pre>
			<p>This is why <a id="_idIndexMarker281"/>using code blocks, even for one statement, is very helpful. Throughout the book, we will use proper indentation and code blocks <a id="_idIndexMarker282"/>to aid clarity and ease <span class="No-Break">of understanding.</span></p>
			<p>Now, let us look at a more involved example. This example (and others to follow) use the pre-defined <strong class="source-inline">Scanner</strong> class <a id="_idIndexMarker283"/>from the Java <strong class="bold">Application Programming Interface</strong> (<strong class="bold">API</strong>). The API is a suite of pre-defined types (for example classes) that are available for our use. We will cover these topics as we progress through the book but suffice to say that the API is extremely useful as it provides pre-defined and well-tested code for <span class="No-Break">our use.</span></p>
			<p>The <strong class="source-inline">Scanner</strong> class resides in the <strong class="source-inline">java.util</strong> package. Therefore, we need to briefly discuss both packages and the <span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">Scanner</strong></span><span class="No-Break"> class.</span></p>
			<h3>Packages</h3>
			<p>A package is a <a id="_idIndexMarker284"/>group of related types, such as classes, that we can use. Conveniently, many are already available for us to use in <span class="No-Break">the API.</span></p>
			<p>To gain access to these types, we need to “import” them into our code. For this purpose, Java provides the <strong class="source-inline">import</strong> keyword. Any <strong class="source-inline">import</strong> statements go at the top of your file. We can import a whole package using the <strong class="source-inline">*</strong> wildcard; for example: <strong class="source-inline">import java.util.*;</strong>. We can also import a particular type explicitly by naming it in the <strong class="source-inline">import</strong> statement; for example: <span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">import java.util.Scanner;</strong></span><span class="No-Break">.</span></p>
			<p>When you precede the type with its package name, such as <strong class="source-inline">java.util.Scanner</strong>, this is known as the “fully qualified name”. We could omit the <strong class="source-inline">import</strong> statement and simply refer each time to <strong class="source-inline">Scanner</strong> using its fully qualified name; in other words, everywhere <strong class="source-inline">Scanner</strong> is mentioned, replace it with <strong class="source-inline">java.util.Scanner</strong>. Generally speaking, however, importing the type and using its non-qualified name <span class="No-Break">is preferred.</span></p>
			<p>There is <a id="_idIndexMarker285"/>one package that is automatically available (imported) for us and that is the <strong class="source-inline">java.lang</strong> package. For example, the <strong class="source-inline">String</strong> class resides in <strong class="source-inline">java.lang</strong> and that is why we never have to import anything to get access to the <span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">String</strong></span><span class="No-Break"> class.</span></p>
			<h3>Scanner class</h3>
			<p>It is helpful to know that while <strong class="source-inline">Scanner</strong> is a versatile class, for our purposes, we will simply use <strong class="source-inline">Scanner</strong> to enable us to retrieve keyboard input from the user. With this in mind, note that <strong class="source-inline">System.in</strong> used in the examples refers to the standard input stream which is already open and ready to supply input data. Typically, this corresponds to <a id="_idIndexMarker286"/>the keyboard. <strong class="source-inline">System.in</strong> is therefore perfect for getting input data from the user via the keyboard. The <strong class="source-inline">Scanner</strong> class provides various methods <a id="_idIndexMarker287"/>for parsing/interpreting the keyboard input. For example, when the user types in a number at the keyboard, the method <strong class="source-inline">nextInt()</strong> provides that number to us as an <strong class="source-inline">int</strong> primitive. We will avail of these methods in <span class="No-Break">our examples.</span></p>
			<h3>Nested if statements</h3>
			<p>Now that we have discussed packages and <strong class="source-inline">Scanner</strong>, in <span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Figure 4</em></span><em class="italic">.6</em> and <span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Figure 4</em></span><em class="italic">.7</em>, we discuss a <a id="_idIndexMarker288"/>more involved <strong class="source-inline">if-else</strong> example that deals with <a id="_idIndexMarker289"/>input from the user (via the keyboard). Both figures relate to the one example. <span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Figure 4</em></span><em class="italic">.6</em> focuses on the declaration of constants to make the code more readable. In addition, <span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Figure 4</em></span><em class="italic">.6</em> also focuses on declaring and using <strong class="source-inline">Scanner</strong>. On the other hand, <span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Figure 4</em></span><em class="italic">.7</em> focuses on the subsequent <span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">if-else</strong></span><span class="No-Break"> structure.</span></p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer043" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B19793_04_6.jpg" alt="Figure 4.6 – Using Scanner to get input from the keyboard"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 4.6 – Using Scanner to get input from the keyboard</p>
			<p>Lines 11 to 14 define constants using the keyword <strong class="source-inline">final</strong>. This means that their values cannot change. It is good practice to use uppercase identifiers for constants (where words are separated by underscores). This will make the code in <span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Figure 4</em></span><em class="italic">.7</em> more readable; in other words, instead of comparing <strong class="source-inline">month</strong> with <strong class="source-inline">1</strong> (which, in this context, means January), we will compare <strong class="source-inline">month</strong> with <strong class="source-inline">JAN</strong>, which reads better. For brevity’s sake, we have declared three constants per line but you can easily declare one per <span class="No-Break">line also.</span></p>
			<p>Line 16 in <span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Figure 4</em></span><em class="italic">.6</em> creates our <strong class="source-inline">Scanner</strong> object reference, <strong class="source-inline">sc</strong>. Essentially, we are creating a reference, namely <strong class="source-inline">sc</strong>, which refers to the <strong class="source-inline">Scanner</strong> object created using the <strong class="source-inline">new</strong> keyword. As stated previously, <strong class="source-inline">System.in</strong> means that <strong class="source-inline">sc</strong> is looking at the keyboard. This reference is what we will use to interact with <strong class="source-inline">Scanner</strong>, much like a remote control is used to interact with <span class="No-Break">a television.</span></p>
			<p>Line 17 prompts the user to enter a month (<strong class="source-inline">1..12</strong>) on the keyboard. This is actually very important because, without the prompt, the cursor will just blink and the user will wonder what they should type in. Line 18 is where <strong class="source-inline">Scanner</strong> really comes into its own. Here we use the <strong class="source-inline">nextInt()</strong> method to get in a number. For the moment, just know that when we call <strong class="source-inline">sc.nextInt()</strong>, Java does not return to our code until the user has typed in something and hit the return key. For the <a id="_idIndexMarker290"/>moment, we will make the (convenient) assumption <a id="_idIndexMarker291"/>that it is an integer. We will store the <strong class="source-inline">int</strong> primitive returned in our own <strong class="source-inline">int</strong> primitive, <strong class="source-inline">month</strong>. Now, in our code, we can use what the user typed in. <span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Figure 4</em></span><em class="italic">.7</em> shows this <span class="No-Break">in action.</span></p>

			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 4.7 – A complex if statement</p>
			<p>Note that the code presented in the preceding image is a <em class="italic">continuation</em> of <span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Figure 4</em></span><em class="italic">.6</em>. On line 20, we declare an <strong class="source-inline">int</strong> variable, namely <strong class="source-inline">numDays</strong>, and initialize it to <strong class="source-inline">0</strong>. Lines 21 to 22 are the start of the <strong class="source-inline">if</strong> statement. Using the <strong class="source-inline">boolean</strong> logical OR operator, the <strong class="source-inline">if</strong> statement checks to see whether the <strong class="source-inline">month</strong> value matches any of the constants defined in <span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Figure 4</em></span><em class="italic">.6</em>. In the background, the constant values are used, so in reality, the <strong class="source-inline">if</strong> statement is <span class="No-Break">as follows:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
if(month == 1 || month == 3 || month == 5 || month == 7 ||   month == 8 || month == 10 || month == 12)</pre>
			<p>Note that the <strong class="source-inline">month</strong> variable must be specified each time. In other words, <strong class="source-inline">if(month == JAN || MAR || MAY || JUL || AUG || OCT || DEC)</strong> will <span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">not</em></span><span class="No-Break"> compile.</span></p>
			<p>So, assuming that the user typed in <strong class="source-inline">1</strong> (representing January), <strong class="source-inline">month</strong> becomes <strong class="source-inline">1</strong> and, as a result, lines 21 to 22 evaluate to true and <strong class="source-inline">numDays</strong> is set to <strong class="source-inline">31</strong> on line 23. The logic is the same if the user types in <strong class="source-inline">3</strong>, <strong class="source-inline">5</strong>, <strong class="source-inline">7</strong>, <strong class="source-inline">8</strong>, <strong class="source-inline">10</strong>, and <strong class="source-inline">12</strong>, representing March, May, July, August, October, and <span class="No-Break">December, respectively.</span></p>
			<p>If the user types in <strong class="source-inline">4</strong> (representing April), lines 21 to 22 evaluate to false and the <strong class="source-inline">else if</strong> statement on line 24 is evaluated. Line 24 evaluates to true and <strong class="source-inline">numdays</strong> is set to <strong class="source-inline">30</strong> on line 25. The logic is <a id="_idIndexMarker292"/>the same if the user types in <strong class="source-inline">6</strong>, <strong class="source-inline">9</strong>, and <strong class="source-inline">11</strong>, representing June, September, and <span class="No-Break">November, respectively.</span></p>
			<p>Now, let us deal <a id="_idIndexMarker293"/>with the user typing in <strong class="source-inline">2</strong>, representing February. The <strong class="source-inline">if</strong> condition on lines 21 to 22 and the <strong class="source-inline">else if</strong> condition on line 24 both evaluate to false. Line 26 evaluates to true. Now, we need to review the leap year logic. Of course, February has 28 days every year (as do all the months!) but has one extra day when the year is a leap year. The logic for determining whether a year is a leap year is <span class="No-Break">as follows:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Scenario A</strong>: <strong class="source-inline">year</strong> is a multiple of 400 =&gt; <span class="No-Break">leap year</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Scenario B</strong>: <strong class="source-inline">year</strong> is a multiple of 4 AND <strong class="source-inline">year</strong> is <em class="italic">not</em> a multiple of 100 =&gt; <span class="No-Break">leap year</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>The following are all leap years: 2000 (satisfies scenario A), 2012, and 2016 (both satisfy <span class="No-Break">scenario B).</span></p>
			<p>As the leap year algorithm depends on the year, we first need the year from the user. Lines 27 to 28 accomplish this. We then encounter a nested <strong class="source-inline">if</strong> statement from lines 30 to 34, which determines, according to the logic just outlined, whether the year entered by the user is a leap year. Line 30 implements the logic for both scenarios A and B. Whether <strong class="source-inline">year</strong> is a multiple of 400 is achieved with <strong class="source-inline">(year % 400 == 0)</strong>. The condition of <strong class="source-inline">year</strong> being a multiple of 4 and not a multiple of 100 is <span class="No-Break">achieved with</span></p>
			<p><strong class="source-inline">(year % 4 == 0 &amp;&amp; !( year % 100 == 0))</strong>. The fact that either condition satisfies the leap year calculation is achieved by using the logical OR operator between them. Assuming a year of 2000, line 30 would be true and <strong class="source-inline">numDays</strong> is set to <strong class="source-inline">29</strong>. Assuming a year of 1900, the <strong class="source-inline">if</strong> statement on line 30 is false and, as there is no condition on line 32 (it is just an <strong class="source-inline">else</strong> statement), line 33 is executed, setting <strong class="source-inline">numDays</strong> <span class="No-Break">to </span><span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">28</strong></span><span class="No-Break">.</span></p>
			<p>An invalid <strong class="source-inline">month</strong> value of, for example, <strong class="source-inline">25</strong> or <strong class="source-inline">-3</strong> would result in the <strong class="source-inline">else</strong> branch on line 35 being executed. An error message would be output to the screen on line 36 as <span class="No-Break">a result.</span></p>
			<p>Lines 38 to 40 output <a id="_idIndexMarker294"/>the number of days provided that <strong class="source-inline">numDays</strong> was changed from its initial value of <strong class="source-inline">0</strong>. The <strong class="source-inline">if</strong> statement on line 38 prevents <a id="_idIndexMarker295"/>the message <strong class="source-inline">"Number of days is: 0"</strong> from appearing on the screen if the user typed in an invalid <span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">month</strong></span><span class="No-Break"> value.</span></p>
			<p>That concludes our treatment of the <strong class="source-inline">if</strong> statement. Now, let us examine both <strong class="source-inline">switch</strong> statements and expressions, which can, in certain situations, be a more <span class="No-Break">elegant option.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-96"><a id="_idTextAnchor096"/>Mastering switch statements and expressions</h1>
			<p>Complicated <strong class="source-inline">if</strong> statements, with <a id="_idIndexMarker296"/>many <strong class="source-inline">else if</strong> branches and an <strong class="source-inline">else</strong> branch can be verbose. The <strong class="source-inline">switch</strong> structure can, in many situations, be more concise and elegant. Let us start with <span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">switch</strong></span><span class="No-Break"> statements.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-97"><a id="_idTextAnchor097"/>switch statements</h2>
			<p>Firstly, let us examine the syntax of the <strong class="source-inline">switch</strong> statement. <span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Figure 4</em></span><em class="italic">.8</em> introduces <span class="No-Break">the syntax.</span></p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer045" class="IMG---Figure">

				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 4.8 – The switch statement syntax</p>
			<p>A <strong class="source-inline">switch</strong> statement evaluates an expression. As of Java 21, the expression can be an integral primitive (excluding <strong class="source-inline">long</strong>) or any reference type. This means that we can <strong class="source-inline">switch</strong> on primitive variables of type <strong class="source-inline">byte</strong>, <strong class="source-inline">char</strong>, <strong class="source-inline">short</strong>, or <strong class="source-inline">int</strong> and also <strong class="source-inline">switch</strong> on class types, enum types, record types and array types. The <strong class="source-inline">case</strong> labels can now include a <strong class="source-inline">null</strong> label. Java 21 also brought in <em class="italic">pattern matching for switch</em>. We will present another <strong class="source-inline">switch</strong> example demonstrating this feature when we have those topics covered (<a href="B19793_09.xhtml#_idTextAnchor205"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 9</em></span></a>). Until then, we will focus on the more <span class="No-Break">traditional </span><span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">switch</strong></span><span class="No-Break">.</span></p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Wrapper types</p>
			<p class="callout">For each of the primitive types, there is a corresponding class, known as a “wrapper type”: <strong class="source-inline">byte</strong> (wrapped by <strong class="source-inline">Byte</strong>), <strong class="source-inline">short</strong> (<strong class="source-inline">Short</strong>), <strong class="source-inline">int</strong> (<strong class="source-inline">Integer</strong>), <strong class="source-inline">long</strong> (<strong class="source-inline">Long</strong>), <strong class="source-inline">float</strong> (<strong class="source-inline">Float</strong>), <strong class="source-inline">double</strong> (<strong class="source-inline">Double</strong>), <strong class="source-inline">boolean</strong> (<strong class="source-inline">Boolean</strong>), and <strong class="source-inline">char</strong> (<strong class="source-inline">Character</strong>). They are so called because they represent objects that encapsulate the primitive. As they are class types, useful methods are available. For example, <strong class="source-inline">int val = Integer.parseInt("22");</strong> converts the <strong class="source-inline">String "22"</strong> into the number <strong class="source-inline">22</strong>, stored in <strong class="source-inline">val</strong>, where we can <span class="No-Break">perform arithmetic.</span></p>
			<p>The expression just <a id="_idIndexMarker297"/>evaluated is compared against the <strong class="source-inline">case</strong> labels. The <strong class="source-inline">case</strong> labels are compile-time constants of the same type as the <strong class="source-inline">switch</strong> expression. If there is a match with a <strong class="source-inline">case</strong> label, the associated block of code is executed (note: no need for curly braces in the <strong class="source-inline">case</strong> or <strong class="source-inline">default</strong> blocks). To exit the <strong class="source-inline">case</strong> block, ensure you insert a <strong class="source-inline">break</strong> statement. The <strong class="source-inline">break</strong> statement exits the <strong class="source-inline">switch</strong> block. However, the <strong class="source-inline">break</strong> statement is optional. If you omit the <strong class="source-inline">break</strong> statement, the code <em class="italic">falls through</em> to the next <strong class="source-inline">case</strong> label (or <strong class="source-inline">default</strong>), even though there is <span class="No-Break">no match.</span></p>
			<p>The <strong class="source-inline">default</strong> keyword is used to specify a code block to execute if none of the <strong class="source-inline">case</strong> labels match. Typically, it is coded at the end of the <strong class="source-inline">switch</strong> block but this is not mandatory. In effect, <strong class="source-inline">default</strong> can appear anywhere in the <strong class="source-inline">switch</strong> block with similar semantics (this is a poor programming <span class="No-Break">practice, however).</span></p>
			<p><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Figure 4</em></span><em class="italic">.9</em> presents <span class="No-Break">an example.</span></p>

			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 4.9 – switch on a String example</p>
			<p>Using the <strong class="source-inline">Scanner</strong> class, lines 18 to 20 ask and retrieve from the user a sport. Note that the <strong class="source-inline">Scanner</strong> method used on this occasion is <strong class="source-inline">next()</strong>, which returns a <strong class="source-inline">String</strong> type (as opposed to a <span class="No-Break">primitive type).</span></p>
			<p>Lines 21 to 31 present the <strong class="source-inline">switch</strong> block. Note that the <strong class="source-inline">case</strong> labels on lines 22 and 25 are both <strong class="source-inline">String</strong> compile-time constants. If the user types in <strong class="source-inline">"Soccer"</strong>, the <strong class="source-inline">case</strong> label on line 22 matches, and both lines 23 and 24 will execute. Interestingly, even though there are <a id="_idIndexMarker298"/>two statements to be executed, there is no need for curly braces here. This is a feature of <strong class="source-inline">switch</strong> blocks. As line 22 matched, line 23 will execute, and <strong class="source-inline">"I play soccer"</strong> will be echoed to the screen. The <strong class="source-inline">break</strong> statement on line 24 ensures that the <strong class="source-inline">switch</strong> block is exited and that the <strong class="source-inline">"Rugby"</strong> section is <span class="No-Break">not executed.</span></p>
			<p>If, on the other hand, the user types in <strong class="source-inline">"Rugby"</strong>, line 25 matches, and <strong class="source-inline">"I play Rugby"</strong> is echoed to the screen. Again, the <strong class="source-inline">break</strong> statement, this time on line 27, ensures that the <strong class="source-inline">switch</strong> block is exited and that the <strong class="source-inline">default</strong> section is <span class="No-Break">not executed.</span></p>
			<p>If the user typed in <strong class="source-inline">"Tennis"</strong>, then neither of the <strong class="source-inline">case</strong> labels on lines 22 and 25 will match. This is when the <strong class="source-inline">default</strong> section comes into play. When there are no matches with any <strong class="source-inline">case</strong> label, the <strong class="source-inline">default</strong> section is executed. Typically, the <strong class="source-inline">default</strong> section is coded at the end of the <strong class="source-inline">switch</strong> block and the <strong class="source-inline">break</strong> statement is traditionally inserted <span class="No-Break">for completeness.</span></p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Case labels are case-sensitive</p>
			<p class="callout">Note that the <strong class="source-inline">case</strong> labels are case-sensitive. In other words, in <span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Figure 4</em></span><em class="italic">.9</em>, if the user types in <strong class="source-inline">"soccer"</strong>, the <strong class="source-inline">case</strong> label on line 22 will <em class="italic">not </em>match. The <strong class="source-inline">"Rugby"</strong> case label will not match either, naturally. Thus, the default section will execute, and <strong class="source-inline">"Unknown sport"</strong> will echo (print) to <span class="No-Break">the screen.</span></p>
			<p>Let us look <a id="_idIndexMarker299"/>at another example. <span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Figure 4</em></span><em class="italic">.10</em> is a <strong class="source-inline">switch</strong> statement based <span class="No-Break">on integers.</span></p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer047" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B19793_04_10.jpg" alt="Figure 4.10 – switch on an integer example"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 4.10 – switch on an integer example</p>
			<p>In the preceding figure, line 37 declares a compile-time constant, <strong class="source-inline">two</strong>, and initializes it to the integer literal, <strong class="source-inline">2</strong>. Line 38 starts the <strong class="source-inline">switch</strong> block by switching on an <strong class="source-inline">int</strong> variable named <strong class="source-inline">number</strong>, which was declared and initialized based on user input, on line 36. All of the <strong class="source-inline">case</strong> labels in the <strong class="source-inline">switch</strong> block must now be integers – be they literal values as on lines 39 to 43 and line 47, or compile-time constants as on line 46. Note that if the <strong class="source-inline">two</strong> variable is not <em class="italic">final</em>, a compile-time error is generated (as it is no longer <span class="No-Break">a constant).</span></p>
			<p>In this example, we have multiple labels together, such as, lines 39-43. This section of code can be read as <em class="italic">if number is 1 or 3 or 5 or 7 or 9, then do the following</em>. So, for example, if the user types in <strong class="source-inline">1</strong>, the <strong class="source-inline">case</strong> label on line 39 matches. This is known as the <em class="italic">entry point</em> of the <strong class="source-inline">switch</strong> statement. As there is no <strong class="source-inline">break</strong> statement on line 39, the code <em class="italic">falls through</em> to line 40, even though line 40 has a <strong class="source-inline">case</strong> label for <strong class="source-inline">3</strong>. Again, line 40 has no <strong class="source-inline">break</strong> statement and the code <em class="italic">falls through</em> to line 41. In fact, the code keeps executing from the entry point until it reaches a <strong class="source-inline">break</strong> statement (or the end of the <strong class="source-inline">switch</strong> statement itself). This <em class="italic">fall-through</em> behavior is what enables the <em class="italic">if it’s 1 or 3 or 5 or 7 or 9</em> type logic to work. If this <em class="italic">fall-through</em> behavior were not present, we would have to duplicate lines 44 to 45 for each of the <strong class="source-inline">case</strong> labels! Line 44 uses the <strong class="source-inline">String</strong> append to output that the number entered is odd, by appending <strong class="source-inline">"is odd"</strong> to the number – for example, <strong class="source-inline">"7 is odd"</strong>. Line 45 is the <strong class="source-inline">break</strong> statement that ensures we exit the <span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">switch</strong></span><span class="No-Break"> block.</span></p>
			<p>Line 46 is just to <a id="_idIndexMarker300"/>demonstrate that compile-time constants work for <strong class="source-inline">case</strong> labels. Line 47 shows that the <strong class="source-inline">case</strong> labels can be organized in a horizontal fashion if so desired. Remember, the use of indentation and spacing is just for human readability – the compiler just sees one long sequence of characters. So, lines 46 to 47 match for the numbers 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10. Again, the <em class="italic">fall-through</em> logic is used to keep the code concise. Lines 48 to 49 output that that number is even and <strong class="source-inline">break </strong>out of the <span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">switch</strong></span><span class="No-Break"> block.</span></p>
			<p>Line 50 is the <strong class="source-inline">default</strong> section, which caters to any numbers outside of the <strong class="source-inline">1..10</strong> range. Line 51 outputs that the number entered is out of range, and line 52 is the <strong class="source-inline">break</strong> statement. While the <strong class="source-inline">break</strong> statement is not strictly needed here (as <strong class="source-inline">default</strong> is at the bottom of the <strong class="source-inline">switch</strong> statement), it is considered good practice to <span class="No-Break">include it.</span></p>
			<p>Let us rewrite the code in <span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Figure 4</em></span><em class="italic">.7</em> using a <strong class="source-inline">switch</strong> statement instead of a complicated <strong class="source-inline">if-else</strong> statement. Note that <span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Figure 4</em></span><em class="italic">.6</em> is still relevant in declaring <strong class="source-inline">Scanner</strong> and the constants used; this is why we separated <span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Figure 4</em></span><em class="italic">.6</em> (so we could use it with both the <strong class="source-inline">if</strong> and <strong class="source-inline">switch</strong> code). <span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Figure 4</em></span><em class="italic">.11</em> represents <span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Figure 4</em></span><em class="italic">.7</em> refactored using a <span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">switch</strong></span><span class="No-Break"> statement.</span></p>

			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 4.11 – Refactoring an if statement with a switch statement</p>
			<p>In the preceding figure, we can see the <strong class="source-inline">switch</strong> statement starts on line 23. The first group of <strong class="source-inline">case</strong> labels is <a id="_idIndexMarker301"/>on line 24 and the second group is on line 27. February, the odd one out, has a <strong class="source-inline">case</strong> label to itself (line 30). Finally, the <strong class="source-inline">default</strong> label is on line 40. Personally speaking, I find the use of <strong class="source-inline">switch</strong> in this example preferable due to the absence of the multiple logical OR expressions required in <span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Figure 4</em></span><em class="italic">.7</em> (lines 21 to 22 <span class="No-Break">and 24).</span></p>
			<p>Now that we have covered valid <strong class="source-inline">switch</strong> statements, let us examine, in <span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Figure 4</em></span><em class="italic">.12</em>, a few scenarios where compiler errors <span class="No-Break">can arise.</span></p>

			<p>In the preceding figure, we are switching on a <strong class="source-inline">byte</strong> variable, <strong class="source-inline">b</strong>. Recall that the valid <strong class="source-inline">byte</strong> range is <strong class="source-inline">-128</strong> to <strong class="source-inline">+127</strong>. Line 60 demonstrates that the minimum and maximum values are fine. Line 63 shows that, as <strong class="source-inline">128</strong> is out of range for our <strong class="source-inline">byte</strong> type <strong class="source-inline">b</strong>, the <strong class="source-inline">case</strong> labels that <a id="_idIndexMarker302"/>are out of range of the <strong class="source-inline">switch</strong> variable cause a compiler error. Line 64 was fine until line 65 used the same <strong class="source-inline">case</strong> label – <strong class="source-inline">case</strong> label duplicates are <span class="No-Break">not allowed.</span></p>
			<p>We will finish our discussion on <strong class="source-inline">switch</strong> by discussing <span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">switch</strong></span><span class="No-Break"> expressions.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-98"><a id="_idTextAnchor098"/>switch expressions</h2>
			<p>Like all expressions, <strong class="source-inline">switch</strong> expressions evaluate to a single value and, therefore, enable us to <a id="_idIndexMarker303"/>return values. All the <strong class="source-inline">switch</strong> examples so far have been <strong class="source-inline">switch</strong> <em class="italic">statements</em>, which return nothing. Note that in a <strong class="source-inline">switch</strong> expression, <strong class="source-inline">break</strong> statements are <span class="No-Break">not allowed.</span></p>
			<p>On the other hand, <strong class="source-inline">switch</strong> <em class="italic">expressions</em> return something – either implicitly or explicitly (using <strong class="source-inline">yield</strong>). We will explain <strong class="source-inline">yield</strong> shortly, but note that <strong class="source-inline">yield</strong> cannot be used in a <strong class="source-inline">switch</strong> statement (as they do not return anything). In addition, <strong class="source-inline">switch</strong> statements can <em class="italic">fall through</em>, whereas <strong class="source-inline">switch</strong> expressions do not. These differences are encapsulated in <span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Table 4.1</em></span><span class="No-Break">.</span></p>

Line 39 outputs <strong class="source-inline">4</strong> to <span class="No-Break">the screen.</span></p>
			<p>Notice that the code is quite verbose and requires the correct use of the <strong class="source-inline">break</strong> statement to prevent fall through. Plus, these <strong class="source-inline">break</strong> statements are tedious to write and easy to forget. <span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Figure 4</em></span><em class="italic">.14</em> represents <span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Figure 4</em></span><em class="italic">.13</em> written using a <span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">switch</strong></span><span class="No-Break"> expression.</span></p>

			<p>The preceding figure shows the new <strong class="source-inline">case</strong> label where the labels are comma-delimited and an arrow token <a id="_idIndexMarker305"/>separates the labels from the expression (or code block). There is no <strong class="source-inline">break</strong> statement required anywhere as there is no fall-through behavior to worry about. As <strong class="source-inline">name</strong> is still <strong class="source-inline">"Jane"</strong> (from <span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Figure 4</em></span><em class="italic">.13</em>, line 17), line 42 is executed, which initializes/returns <strong class="source-inline">4</strong> into <strong class="source-inline">nLetters</strong>. Thus, line 50 outputs <strong class="source-inline">4</strong>. Note that the list of <strong class="source-inline">case</strong> labels in a <strong class="source-inline">switch</strong> expression must be exhaustive. In almost all cases, this means that a <strong class="source-inline">default</strong> clause is required. The <strong class="source-inline">default</strong> clause in this example executes a code block (lines 45-48), where an error is output to the screen and using the <strong class="source-inline">yield</strong> keyword, <strong class="source-inline">nLetters</strong> is initialized to (an error value <span class="No-Break">of) </span><span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">–1</strong></span><span class="No-Break">.</span></p>
			<p>We can omit the need for the <strong class="source-inline">nLetters</strong> variable by returning the expression value straight into the <strong class="source-inline">System.out.println()</strong> statement. <span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Figure 4</em></span><em class="italic">.15</em> <span class="No-Break">demonstrates this.</span></p>

			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 4.15 – A switch expression returning straight to System.out.println()</p>
			<p>In the preceding figure, there is no variable used to store the result of the <strong class="source-inline">switch</strong> expression. This makes the code even more concise. The result of the <strong class="source-inline">switch</strong> expression is returned straight into the <strong class="source-inline">System.out.println()</strong> statement. Again, <strong class="source-inline">4</strong> is output to <span class="No-Break">the screen.</span></p>

			<p><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Figure 4</em></span><em class="italic">.14 </em>and <span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Figure 4</em></span><em class="italic">.15</em> were simple <strong class="source-inline">switch</strong> expressions, where (for the most part), to the right of the arrow token <a id="_idIndexMarker306"/>was the value to be returned. However, instead of <a id="_idIndexMarker307"/>simply returning a value, what if you wished to execute a code block? This is where <strong class="source-inline">yield</strong> is used. <span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Figure 4</em></span><em class="italic">.16</em> shows the use of <strong class="source-inline">yield</strong> in a <span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">switch</strong></span><span class="No-Break"> expression.</span></p>

			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 4.16 – A switch expression using yield</p>
			<p>The preceding figure <a id="_idIndexMarker308"/>highlights the fact that, if you need to <a id="_idIndexMarker309"/>execute more than one statement in a <strong class="source-inline">switch</strong> expression, you must provide a code block. This is shown with the curly braces for lines 61-64, 65-68, 69-72 and 73-76. To return an expression result from a code block we use <strong class="source-inline">yield</strong>. This is what is done on lines 63, 67, 71 and 75, where <strong class="source-inline">4</strong>, <strong class="source-inline">5</strong>, <strong class="source-inline">6</strong> and <strong class="source-inline">–1</strong> are returned, respectively. As <strong class="source-inline">name</strong> is still <strong class="source-inline">"Jane"</strong>, line 63 returns <strong class="source-inline">4</strong> from the <strong class="source-inline">switch</strong> expression, initializing <strong class="source-inline">nLetters</strong> to <strong class="source-inline">4</strong>. Therefore, line 78 <span class="No-Break">outputs </span><span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">4</strong></span><span class="No-Break">.</span></p>
			<p>To aid flexibility, you can, up to a point, mix the syntaxes. In other words, regular <strong class="source-inline">case</strong> labels can be used in <strong class="source-inline">switch</strong> expressions, and the new <strong class="source-inline">case</strong> labels syntax can be used in <strong class="source-inline">switch</strong> statements. However, as stated earlier, <strong class="source-inline">break</strong> only appears in <strong class="source-inline">switch</strong> <em class="italic">statements</em> and <strong class="source-inline">yield</strong> only appears (if required) in switch <em class="italic">expressions</em>. <span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Figure 4</em></span><em class="italic">.17</em> is a refactor of the verbose <strong class="source-inline">switch</strong> statement in <span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Figure 4</em></span><em class="italic">.13</em>, where the new <strong class="source-inline">case</strong> labels are used in a <span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">switch</strong></span><span class="No-Break"> statement.</span></p>

			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 4.17 – A switch statement using new case labels and an arrow token</p>
			<p>In the preceding figure, the labels are comma-delimited and the arrow token is present. As before, on the <a id="_idIndexMarker310"/>right of the arrow token, we have the initialization of <strong class="source-inline">nLetters</strong> to the number of letters in the name. However, in contrast to <span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Figure 4</em></span><em class="italic">.13</em>, as we are <a id="_idIndexMarker311"/>using the arrow token, no <strong class="source-inline">break</strong> statements are required.

			<p>We can also use the regular <strong class="source-inline">case</strong> labels with <strong class="source-inline">switch</strong> expressions.

			<p>In the preceding figure, the old-style <strong class="source-inline">case</strong> labels are used. This means that the keyword <strong class="source-inline">case</strong> must precede each label. The curly braces for the code blocks can, however, be omitted. As it is a <strong class="source-inline">switch</strong> expression, where there is more than one statement to be executed when a match is found, we need to use <strong class="source-inline">yield</strong> to return the expression result. As the <strong class="source-inline">name</strong> variable has <a id="_idIndexMarker312"/>never been changed from <strong class="source-inline">"Jane"</strong> throughout all <a id="_idIndexMarker313"/>the examples, a match is made on line 95, resulting in line 99 outputting <strong class="source-inline">"There are 4 letters in: Jane"</strong> to the screen. The <strong class="source-inline">yield</strong> on line 100 returns <strong class="source-inline">4</strong>, and thus, <strong class="source-inline">nLetters</strong> is initialized to <strong class="source-inline">4</strong>. Finally, line 114 outputs <strong class="source-inline">4</strong> to <span class="No-Break">the screen.</span></p>

			<h1 id="_idParaDest-99"><a id="_idTextAnchor099"/>Exercises</h1>
			<p>We finally have the coding capability to make decisions. Mesozoic Eden is going to be benefiting from this so much. Let’s show off our newly acquired skills, <span class="No-Break">shall we?</span></p>
			<ol>
				<li>We need to determine whether a dinosaur is a carnivore or herbivore. Write an <strong class="source-inline">if</strong> statement that prints whether a dinosaur is a carnivore or herbivore based on a <strong class="source-inline">boolean</strong> variable. This information is critical for feeding and <span class="No-Break">care guidelines.</span></li>
				<li>Different species require different care strategies and exhibit unique behavior traits. Write a <strong class="source-inline">switch</strong> statement that prints a description of a dinosaur based on its species. This will help educate both the staff and <span class="No-Break">park visitors.</span></li>
				<li>Some dinosaurs are tougher to handle than others. Write an <strong class="source-inline">if</strong> statement that checks whether a number of years of experience is enough experience to work with a certain type of dinosaur. This ensures the safety of both our dinosaurs <span class="No-Break">and employees.</span></li>
				<li>We are working with beautiful but dangerous creatures. So, safety first. Write a program that prints a warning message if the park’s safety rating falls below a certain threshold. We must always be alert to potential issues that could harm our staff, visitors, <span class="No-Break">or dinosaurs.</span></li>
				<li>Proper housing is essential for the dinosaurs’ well-being. Write a <strong class="source-inline">switch</strong> statement that assigns a dinosaur to a specific enclosure based on its size (XS, S, M, L, <span class="No-Break">or XL).</span></li>
				<li>Proper nutrition is crucial for maintaining our dinosaurs’ health. Write an <strong class="source-inline">if</strong> statement that determines the number of feeds a dinosaur requires per day based on <span class="No-Break">its weight.</span></li>
				<li>It is important to delegate tasks properly to keep operations running smoothly. Create a program that assigns different duties to employees based on their job titles using a <span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">switch</strong></span><span class="No-Break"> statement.</span></li>
				<li>The park is not open to day visitors 24/7. Write an <strong class="source-inline">if</strong> statement that checks whether the park is open for them based on the time. They are open for day visitors from 10 A.M. to 7 P.M. This helps in managing visitor expectations and <span class="No-Break">staff schedules.</span></li>
			</ol>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-100"><a id="_idTextAnchor100"/>Project – Task allocation system</h1>
			<p>The manager of <a id="_idIndexMarker314"/>Mesozoic Eden needs a systematic way of managing the team and ensuring all tasks are <span class="No-Break">efficiently accomplished.</span></p>
			<p>Design a simple program that assigns tasks to the Mesozoic Eden employees based on their roles (for example, feeding, cleaning, security, and tour guiding). The program should decide tasks based on time, the employee’s role, and other factors, such as the park’s <span class="No-Break">safety rating.</span></p>
			<p>This program would not only help streamline operations but also ensure the safety and satisfaction of our staff, visitors, and, most importantly, <span class="No-Break">our dinosaurs!</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-101"><a id="_idTextAnchor101"/>Summary</h1>
			<p>In this chapter, we started by explaining that Java uses block scope. A block is delimited by <strong class="source-inline">{ }</strong>. A variable is visible from the point of declaration to the closing <strong class="source-inline">}</strong> of that block. As blocks (and therefore, scopes) can be nested, this means that a variable defined in a block is visible to any inner/nested blocks. The inverse is not true, however. A variable declared in an inner block is not visible in an <span class="No-Break">outer block</span></p>
			<p>Conditional statements enable us to make decisions and are based on the evaluation of a condition resulting in true or false. The <strong class="source-inline">if</strong> statement allows several branches to be evaluated. Once one branch evaluates to true and is executed, no other branch is evaluated. An <strong class="source-inline">if</strong> statement can be coded on its own without any <strong class="source-inline">else if</strong> or <strong class="source-inline">else</strong> clause. The <strong class="source-inline">else if</strong> and <strong class="source-inline">else</strong> clauses are optional. However, if an <strong class="source-inline">else</strong> clause is present, it must be the last clause. We saw how a complex <strong class="source-inline">if</strong> example can lead to <span class="No-Break">code verbosity.</span></p>
			<p>We briefly discussed packages and the <strong class="source-inline">Scanner</strong> class. The <strong class="source-inline">Scanner</strong> class resides in the <strong class="source-inline">java.util</strong> package and is very useful for retrieving keyboard input from <span class="No-Break">the user.</span></p>
			<p>We also discussed both <strong class="source-inline">switch</strong> statements and <strong class="source-inline">switch</strong> expressions. An expression can return a value but a statement cannot. We saw how <strong class="source-inline">switch</strong> statements can make complicated <strong class="source-inline">if</strong> statements more concise and elegant. The expression you <strong class="source-inline">switch </strong>on (typically, a variable) can be a primitive <strong class="source-inline">byte</strong>, <strong class="source-inline">char</strong>, <strong class="source-inline">short</strong>, or <strong class="source-inline">int</strong> type ; or a reference type. The <strong class="source-inline">case</strong> labels must be compile-time constants and must be in range for the <strong class="source-inline">switch</strong> variable. <strong class="source-inline">switch</strong> statements have a fall-through feature, which enables multiple <strong class="source-inline">case</strong> labels to use the same section of code without repetition. However, this fall-through behavior requires a <strong class="source-inline">break</strong> statement to exit the <strong class="source-inline">switch</strong> statement. This requires care, as <strong class="source-inline">break</strong> statements are easy <span class="No-Break">to forget.</span></p>
			<p><strong class="source-inline">switch</strong> expressions can return a value. They have no fall-through logic so <strong class="source-inline">break</strong> statements are not required. This makes the code more concise and less error-prone. If you wish to execute a code block in a <strong class="source-inline">switch</strong> expression, use <strong class="source-inline">yield</strong> to return <span class="No-Break">the value.</span></p>
			<p><strong class="source-inline">switch</strong> statements do not support <strong class="source-inline">yield</strong> (as they do not return anything), and <strong class="source-inline">switch</strong> expressions do not support <strong class="source-inline">break</strong> (as they must return something). However, both of the <strong class="source-inline">case</strong> labels, namely the old-style <strong class="source-inline">case X:</strong> and the newer style <strong class="source-inline">case A, B, C -&gt;</strong>, can be used with either <strong class="source-inline">switch</strong> statements or <span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">switch</strong></span><span class="No-Break"> expressions.</span></p>
			<p>Now that we know how to make decisions, we will move on to iteration in the next chapter, where we will examine the Java structures that enable us to <span class="No-Break">repeat statements.</span></p>
