    blow, "is to learn something. That''s the only thing that never fails. You may
    grow old and trembling in your anatomies, you may lie awake at night listening
    to the disorder of your veins, you may miss your only love, you may see the world
    about you devastated by evil lunatics, or know your honour trampled in the sewers
    of baser minds. There is only one thing for it then—to learn. Learn why the world
    wags and what wags it. That is the only thing which the mind can never exhaust,
    never alienate, never be tortured by, never fear or distrust, and never dream
    of regretting. Learning is the only thing for you. Look what a lot of things there
    are to learn."* |   |'

- en: Whether you started this book as a novice programmer, experienced programmer,
    artist, storyteller, or just a highly curious individual, I am sure you have learned
    a lot along the way. We have covered numerous solutions to common problems encountered
    in writing and developing interactive programs. Writing interactive programs requires
    not only technical expertise, but also a clear understanding of how to engage
    and entertain users. We also covered software design, code organization, debugging,
    and an accepted process for software development for an object-oriented language.
    These skills will transfer to future programming projects, even if you end up
    coding in a different programming language.

- en: While we have built programs of some size, we have kept the scope of the work
    small for pedagogical and practical reasons. However, you have the skills to create
    large, complex forms of entertainment. Brainstorm a project for yourself that
    you feel could keep someone engaged, via learning or playing, for over an hour.
    Spend a considerable amount of time on the design, story, and content of your
    project. Before coding, create a storyboard that will serve as an outline of your
    project and as the initial artifact that you can show users (or players) to get
    some early feedback.

- en: Storyboards are an efficient way to explore the design of a movie, play, book,
    or any form of interactive entertainment. For games, they are especially useful.
    In simple terms, a storyboard is very similar to creating a comic book of the
    story you are telling. With storyboards, the individual panes of the comic book
    are put on separate pieces of paper, making it easy to rearrange their order or
    insert/delete specific scenes.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Storyboards provide a medium to quickly understand the sequence, content, and
    flow of a piece of work. As they can be easily pinned on a wall for easy viewing,
    they also work well in aiding collaborations between writers, programmers, musicians,
    and artists. Disney was the first company to use them in their process (1930s)
    to create animated stories.

    Application Design and Theory"), *Interactive Application Design and Theory*,
    and follow the ideas and processes discussed there to carefully grow your project
    in a way that will engage users/players. Remember that a project like this requires
    you to expand the project over time through user/player feedback.

    art? Enlist their help and really give your project a polished and professional
    look. Pay attention to all of the details and enhance all aspects of your project
    to improve the overall experience. Are you a musician or know one? Adding original
    musical scores and sound effects to your project can really elevate its impact.

    others. A music teacher will often arrange recitals for his/her students, giving
    them true motivation for improvement. In the same way, you should always plan
    to share your work with a wider audience. Knowing that your work will be on display
    gives you extra incentive to be thorough and detailed in your work. More importantly,
    sharing your work provides the opportunity to collect valuable feedback from players,
    programmers, and game designers. Feedback from this audience is crucial to perfecting
    your skills.
