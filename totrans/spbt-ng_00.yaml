- en: Spring Boot provides JavaScript users with a platform to get an application
    up and running with just a few lines of code. At the same time, Angular is a component-based
    framework that makes building a web application’s frontend easy. This book explains
    how Spring Boot and Angular work together to help you create full-stack applications
    quickly and effectively.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In this book, you will begin by exploring why Spring Boot and Angular are in-demand
    frameworks, before being guided by expert solutions and best practices to build
    your own web application. Regarding the backend, you will see how Spring Boot
    allows you to build applications efficiently by letting the Spring Framework and
    Spring Boot extension do the heavy lifting, while using Spring Data JPA and Postgres
    dependencies in your project to save or persist data in a database. With the frontend,
    you will use Angular to construct a project architecture, build Reactive forms,
    and add authentication to avoid malicious users stealing data from the application.

    using continuous integration and continuous deployment, and integrate Spring Boot
    and Angular to create a single package so that, by the end of the book, you will
    be able to build your very own full-stack web application.
