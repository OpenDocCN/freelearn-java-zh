- en: A data structure is a way of organizing data so that it can be accessed and/or
    modified efficiently. Learning about data structures and algorithms gives you
    a better insight on how to solve common programming problems. Most of the problems
    faced everyday by programmers have been solved, tried and tested. Knowing how
    these solutions work, ensures that the right tool is chosen when faced with these
    problems.

    It starts with an introduction to algorithms and big O notation, later explains
    bubble, merge, quicksort, and other popular programming patterns. You’ll also
    learn about data structures such as binary trees, hash tables, and graphs. The
    book progresses to advanced concepts, such as algorithm design paradigms and graph
    theory. By the end of the book, you will know how to correctly implement common
    algorithms and data structures within your applications.

- en: If you want to better understand common data structures and algorithms by following
    code examples in Java and improve your application efficiency, then this is the
    book for you. It helps to have basic knowledge of Java, mathematics and object-oriented
    programming techniques.

    how to define an algorithm, measure algorithmic complexity, and identify algorithms
    with different complexities. It also covers how to assess various examples with
    different runtime complexities'

    and Fundamental Data Structures*, explores bubble, quick, and merge sort. We will
    also introduce data structures and study various implementations and use cases
    of linked lists, queues, and stacks. We will also see how some data structures
    can be used as building blocks to build more complex ones.'

    Search Trees*, talks about data structures for implementing the data dictionary
    operation. In addition, binary trees also give us the ability to perform various
    range queries. We will also see examples of both data structures, and implementations
    of these operations.'

    Paradigms*, discusses three different algorithm design paradigms along with example
    problems, and discusses how to identify whether problems may be solvable by one
    of the given paradigms.'

    introduces the string matching problem. This chapter also introduces you to the
    string matching algorithms, starting from the naive search algorithm and improving
    it by using the rules introduced by Boyer and Moore. We''ll also explore some
    other string matching algorithms without going into too much detail about them.'

    and Complexity Classes*, introduces graphs, formalizing what they are and showing two
    different ways to represent them in computer programs. Later, we''ll take a look
    at ways of traversing graphs, using them as building blocks for building more complex
    algorithms. We''ll also look at two different algorithms for finding shortest
    paths in a graph.'
