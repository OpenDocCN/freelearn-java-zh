    together. However, quite often, we have a problem where the component interfaces
    are incompatible with each other. Similarly with using public or any libraries,
    which we cannot modify ourselves, it is quite rare that someone else's views will
    be exactly the same as ours in our current settings. This is where adapters help.
    Their purpose is to help incompatible interfaces work together without modifying
    their source code.

    a new logging library in our application. The library we are trying to use has
    a log method that takes the message and the severity of the log. However, throughout
    our whole application, we expect to have the `info`, `debug`, `warning`, and `error`
    methods that only take the message and automatically set the right severity. Of
    course, we cannot edit the original library code, so we have to use the adapter
    pattern. The following figure shows the class diagram that represents the adapter

    also use an instance of **Logger** as a field. While implementing the methods,
    we then simply call the log method with different parameters. This is the general
    adapter implementation and we will see the code for it in the next subsection.
    There are some cases where extending might not be possible and we will show how
    Scala can deal with this. Also, we will show some advanced usage of the language

    We don't need the `Logger` instance as a field of our class, because our class
    is an instance of `Logger` already and we have access to its methods anyway. If
    we were to expand the behavior of the original `log` method, then we would need
    an instance of `Logger` as well.

    parameter as well. This is useful in cases where creating the logger requires

    Because of this fact, we can use implicit classes to achieve what the adapter

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There is a problem with the last implementation mentioned in the preceding section.
    It is the fact that we will have to always import our package or normal object
    when using the logger. Also, implicit classes and conversions sometimes make the
    code much harder to read and understand. Implicit classes have some limitations,
    as described here: [http://docs.scala-lang.org/overviews/core/implicitclasses.html.](https://docs.scala-lang.org/overviews/core/implicit-classes.html)

    that we cannot change. If we are able to fix our source code, then this might
    be a better decision because using adapters throughout our program will make it

    in an application. This could be done via inheritance; however, we might not want
    to do this or it may affect all the other classes in our application. This is
    where the decorator design pattern is useful.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    without extending them and without affecting the behavior of other objects from
    the same class.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The decorator design pattern works by wrapping the decorated object, and it
    can be applied during runtime. Decorators are extremely useful in the cases where
    there could be multiple extensions of a class and they could be combined in various
    ways. Instead of writing all the possible combinations, decorators can be created
    and they can stack the modifications on top of each other. The next few subsections
    will show how and when to use decorators in real-world situations.

    an interface to a different one. The decorator, on the other hand, helps us to
    enhance an interface by adding extra functionality to methods. For the class diagram,
    we will use an example with data streams. Imagine that we have a basic stream.

    of the `InputReader`. It wraps a standard `BufferedReader`. Then, we have an abstract
    `InputReaderDecorator` class that extends the `InputReader` and contains an instance
    of it. By extending the base decorator, we provide the possibility to have streams
    that capitalize, compress, or `Base64` encode the input they get. We might want
    to have different streams in our application and they could be able to do one
    or more of the preceding operations in different orders. Our code will quickly
    become difficult to maintain and messy if we try and provide all possibilities,
    especially when the number of possible operations is even more. With decorators,
    it is nice and clean, as we will see in the next section.

    advantage of the richness of Scala and uses some of the concepts we looked at
    throughout the initial chapters of this book. The decorator design pattern in
    Scala is also called **stackable traits**. Let's see what it looks like and how
    to use it. The `InputReader` and `AdvancedInputReader` code will remain exactly
    as shown in the previous section. We are actually reusing it in both examples.

  type: TYPE_PRE
- en: As you can see, the implementation here is not much different. Here, we used
    traits instead of classes, extended the base `InputReader` trait, and used `abstract
    override`.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Abstract override allows us to call `super` for a method in a trait that is
    declared abstract. This is permissible for traits as long as the trait is mixed
    in after another trait or a class that implements the preceding method. The abstract
    override tells the compiler that we are doing this on purpose and it will not
    fail our compilation—it will check later, when we use the trait, whether the requirements
    for using it are satisfied.

  type: TYPE_PRE
- en: The output of both the examples will be exactly the same as in the original
    examples. Here, however, we are using mixin composition and things look somewhat
    cleaner. We also have one class less, as we don't need the abstract decorator
    class. Understanding how modifications are applied is also easy—we just follow
    the order in which the stackable traits are mixed in.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Stackable traits follow the rules of linearizationThe fact that in our current
    example the modifications are applied from left to right is deceiving. The reason
    this happens is because we push calls on the stack until we reach the basic implementation
    of `readLines` and then apply modifications in a reverse order. We will see more
    in-depth examples of stackable traits that will showcase all of their specifics
    in the coming chapters of this book.

    forgetting or not foreseeing some use cases with the classes we create.

    with a high number of small classes and they could make our libraries much harder

    complicate the instantiation process, which would require other (creational) design
    patterns, for example, factories or builders.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    functionality. The implementations could be in the form of different algorithms
    or something to do with multiple platforms. The implementations tend to vary often
    and they could also have new implementations throughout the life cycle of a program.
    Moreover, the implementations could be used in different ways for different abstractions.
    In cases like these, it is good to decouple things in our code, or else we are
    in danger of a class explosion.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The purpose of the bridge design pattern is to decouple an abstraction from
    its implementation so that the two can vary independently.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The bridge design pattern is quite useful in the cases where the abstractions
    or the implementations could vary often and independently. If we directly implement
    an abstraction, variations to the abstraction or the implementations would always
    affect all other classes in the hierarchy. This makes it hard to extend, modify,
    and reuse classes independently.

    to do. There are many different hashing algorithms that can be used. Some are
    **SHA-1**, **MD5**, and **SHA-256**. We want to be able to support at least these
    and have the possibility to add new ones easily. There are different hashing strategies—you
    can hash multiple times, combine different hashes, add salt to the passwords,
    and so on. These strategies make our passwords harder to guess using rainbow tables,
    for example. For this example, we will show hashing with salt and simple hashing
