			<p>In this section, we will take an overview of orthogonal context related to architecture design and software architecture implementations. Those cross-cutting topics are crucial to the success of a project and have to be thoroughly considered during the different phases of implementation.</p>
			<p>In this section, we are going to cover some additional concepts, useful to define the context of software architectures. These include cross-cutting concerns (such as identity management and security), the software development life cycle (such as source code management, building, and deployment), and visibility (including log management, monitoring, and tracing). Our last chapter will be about the Java framework per se, including versioning, the vendor ecosystem, and what’s new in the latest release.</p>
			<p>This section comprises the following chapters:</p>
