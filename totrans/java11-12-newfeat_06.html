<p>This section starts with a discussion on lambda parameters, followed by more information on the Epsilon GC, which was introduced in Java 11. Next, we will discuss the HTTP Client API, by means of which your Java code can request HTTP resources over the network. ZGC, which was introduced in Java 11, will also be discussed in detail.
