- en: This book is about Selenium WebDriver, that is, a browser automation tool used
    by software developers and QA engineers to test their web application on different
    web browsers. This book can be used as a reference for your day-to-day usage of
    WebDriver.

- en: Selenium is a set of tools for automating browsers. It is largely used for testing
    applications, but its usages are not limited only to testing. It can also be used
    for screen scraping and automating repetitive tasks in a browser window. Selenium
    supports automation on all the major browsers, including Firefox, Internet Explorer,
    Google Chrome, Safari, and Opera. Selenium WebDriver is now a part of W3C standards,
    and it is supported by major browser vendors.

- en: If you are a quality assurance/testing professional, test engineer, software
    developer, or web application developer looking to create automated test suites
    for your web applications, this is the perfect guide for you! As a prerequisite,
    this book expects you to have a basic understanding of Java programming although
    any previous knowledge of WebDriver or Selenium is not needed. By the end of this
    book, you will have acquired a comprehensive knowledge of WebDriver, which will
    help you in writing your automation tests.

- en: '[Chapter 1](9f647c33-1720-4d7b-973b-7d2ef9dad924.xhtml), *Introducing WebDriver
    and WebElements*, will start off with an overview of Selenium and the features.
    Then, we quickly jump into WebDriver by describing how it perceives a web page.
    We will also look at what a WebDriver''s WebElement is. Then, we talk about locating
    WebElements on a web page and performing some basic actions on them.'

- en: '[Chapter 2](4fc3af9c-b220-478c-91e2-91a0fb58574d.xhtml), *Working with Browser
    Drivers*, will talk about various implementations of WebDriver, such as FirefoxDriver,
    IEDriver, and ChromeDriver. We will configure browser options to run tests in
    headless mode, mobile emulation, and use custom profiles. With WebDriver becoming
    a W3C specification, all major browser vendors now support WebDriver natively
    in the browser.'

    along with Selenium*, will talk about prominent Java 8 features such as Streams
    API and Lambda expressions for processing the list of WebElements. The Stream
    API and Lambda expression help in applying functional programming style to create
    readable and fluent tests.'

    of WebDriver*, will talk about some advanced features of WebDriver, such as taking
    screenshots of web pages, executing JavaScript, handling cookies, and handling
    Windows and Frames.'

- en: '[Chapter 5](ff724e47-f410-4c90-bc11-cf0fbd340773.xhtml), *Exploring Advanced
    Interaction API*, will dive deeply into more advanced actions that WebDriver can
    perform on the WebElements of a web page, such as the dragging and dropping of
    elements from one frame of a page to another and right/context-clicking on WebElements.
    We''re sure you will find this chapter interesting to read.'

    Events*, will deal with the event-handling aspect of WebDriver. To state a few,
    events can be a value change on a WebElement, a browser back-navigation invocation,
    script execution completion, and so on. We will use these events to run accessibility
    and performance checks.'

    will talk about using RemoteWebDriver and Selenium Standalone Server for executing
    tests on remote machines from your machine. You can use the RemoteWebDriver class
    to communicate with the Selenium Standalone Server on a remote machine to run
    commands on the desired browser installed on the remote machine. One of its popular
    use cases is browser compatibility testing.'

    Grid*, will talk about one important and interesting feature of Selenium named
    Selenium Grid. Using this, you can execute automated tests on a distributed computer
    network using Selenium Grid. We will configure a Hub  and Nodes for cross-browser
    testing. This also enables running tests in parallel and in a distributed architecture.'

    proven pattern that will give you a better handle on your automation framework
    and scenarios for better maintainability.'
