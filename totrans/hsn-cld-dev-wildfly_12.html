<p class="western">In this chapter, we will describe briefly what the future of Java EE development is likely to look like—what the plans of evolving the platform are and how concepts provided by applications described in the book may be standardized in the future. We will also take a look at MicroProfile and Jakarta EE projects—describe their purpose, and emphasize how it can help you to move the platform forward at a faster pace.</p>
<p><span>In the first chapter, we have sketched the process in which Java EE standard is being created, emphasizing the benefits it provides: portability and interoperability. It seems that, in order to keep it up with the IT pace, we've had to abandon those benefits. Let's take a look at this problem more thoroughly.</span></p>

<p>Having a number of tools that allow us to immediately take advantage of modern software architectures has made our life easier. These tools have emerged during recent years in order to deal with the problems that have to be solved when building systems consisting of a large number of ephemeral services distributed across the network. It has to be noted that, although we have chosen the proven solutions such as Hystrix or Keycloak, we have lost the mentioned portability and interoperability benefits of Java EE. </p>
<p>The problem was that the process in which the Java EE standard was being created wasn't able to keep up with the rapid pace of the development of the emerging technologies. The specifications that provide a common standard for solving problems associated with cloud architecture (for example, distributed security or network resilience) are not yet a part of Java EE. What are the reasons for that?</p>
<p>The pace at which recent versions of the standard were created was too slow to follow all the recent innovations: Java EE 7 was released in 2013, whereas Java EE 8 was released in 2017. This is not the only problem though. The specifications are designed according to the Java Community Process. The process is meticulous and contains a number of steps that are supposed to make sure that the resulting standard is ready to be published. </p>
<p>This process works well when you are indeed standardizing—extracting the knowledge accumulated by the industry in order to provide common APIs to solve a problem in a proven way. On the other hand, it is not so good for innovation. If solutions to a given problem<span> emerge, the creators of the specification have to effectively guess the correct solution. This is very hard no matter how meticulous the standard process is. </span></p>
<p>So, should we abandon all the standards after all, in order to follow the innovation?  Put it another way; is losing standard benefits of portability, interoperability, and longtime support an inevitable consequence of the pace at which the current IT world is moving? Maybe we can do better than that. Let's discuss Eclipse MicroProfile.</p>

<p>Eclipse MicroProfile is a project that defines a programming model for developing Java microservices (Further reading, link 1). Similar to the Java EE standard, it contains a number of specifications that define the common way to provide functionalities needed by the <kbd>microservices.</kbd></p>
<p>Let's take a look at the current content of the project (version 2.0):</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/d3df709a-bd88-45ab-bffe-47c4681a6592.png" style=""/></div>
<p>As you will have noticed in the preceding diagram, there are a bunch of specifications that have come directly from Java EE, and that we have used extensively in our examples throughout the book (for example, JAX-RS or CDI). However, there are also a number of novel specifications that are supposed to deal with microservices-specific problems. As an example, the JWT Propagation specification deals with token-based security, and fault tolerance deals with the network failures. </p>
<p>As you are able to see, MicroProfile is an emerging project that will allow you to build microservices with portability benefits similar to Java EE. We covered in the preceding chapter that the way in which the Java EE standard was developed was making it less suitable for introducing the innovation. How is the MicroProfile different, then?</p>
<p>The microservices scope is not the only essential characteristic of the MicroProfile project. Another characteristic is the way in which the specifications are being developed. Specifications that constitute MicroProfile are developed in a fast, community-based process; if someone has an idea and a need to introduce something to the project, they can propose it to the community (Further reading, link 2). If the idea is accepted, it can be part of the project, released, and presented to the community.</p>
<p>Based on the community feedback, the specification can be amended in the next release. It is crucial to note that the project assumes a fast release cycle as one of its foundations. Taking these two aspects together, we can see why a process is a good tool for introducing innovation: a lightweight community acceptance process, along with a responsive feedback loop, allow for the quick introduction of new ideas and allows them to quickly evolve.  This sounds great in theory, but does it work in practice?</p>
<p>The way in which the MicroProfile project gains a momentum seems to confirm that. The initial version of the project consisted only of <span>CDI</span>, JAX-RS, and JSON-P specifications. From that time, as you were able to see in the diagram of the current version, a lot of work has been done and a bunch of new specifications has emerged. </p>
<p>If the new way of developing specifications proves itself, you may be able to avoid the innovation/portability compromise. The rapid evolution of a common specification will allow you to provide innovation at a fast pace, whilst simultaneously keeping the benefits that were the strong points of Java EE: multi-vendor competitive implementation, portability, and interoperability between different implementations.</p>
<p>One more thing to mention is that MicroProfile does not assume that the standardization process is obsolete and that there is no longer a place for it. On the contrary, when one of<span> the</span> MicroProfile specifications reach maturity and proves itself within the community, it will be delegated to a standard body and follow the standardization process.</p>

<p>It has been announced that the Java EE brand is changing its name to Jakarta EE, and, similar to MicroProfile, will be a project developed under the governance of the Eclipse foundation. The transformation of the standard is currently taking place, but following the initial success of the MicroProfile initiative it can be expected that the new way in which the standard will be created will learn a lot from its smaller brother, such as the separation of innovation and standardization, and an open community process with fast feedback, providing the latest innovation without sacrificing portability. </p>
<p>If the mentioned efforts prove themselves successful, we can expect a bright future for Enterprise Java being understood as a family of products that originates from the Java EE technology. We will deal with the product based on proven technology, which is based on years of experience and simultaneously alleviating its main drawback by allowing innovation at a fast pace.</p>

<p><span>After reading this book, you hopefully have a wider understanding of emerging enterprise software architectures of cloud computing and microservices. Furthermore, you will be familiar with a number of tools that you can use in order to implement systems taking advantage of both of those. We have shown you how to build microservices using WildFly Swarm, and deploy them in the cloud using OpenShift. In the later parts of the book, we have also shown you how to configure Continuous Deployment using Jenkins, security using Keycloak, and how to make your applications resilient to network failures using Hystrix. The emerging solutions of MicroProfile and Jakarta EE will hopefully make it able to innovate enterprise Java in a faster way. As a result, in the near future, you will be able to take advantage of tools that will allow you to solve problems described in this book based on rapidly developed specifications and, as a result, preserve the portability benefits of Java EE.</span></p>
