- en: Web applications have come a long way in the last 5-10 years. From the glory
    days of Geocities and Friendster, the advent of massively popular websites, in
    the case of social media sites, such as Facebook, and Twitter, and the more utilitarian
    web applications that are Software as a service (SAAS) offerings such as SalesForce
    and Github, there is no denying that with all these advancements in consumer and
    enterprise web software, there arises a need for a solid web technology platform
    to build on top of, not only for end-user web clients but also with a variety
    of sophisticated and complex backend services, all of which can compose the modern
    web application.

    with a powerful and mature web development platform that is lightweight and stateless
    by nature, which was made with development speed and web application scalability
    in mind.

- en: This book aims to give readers a deeper understanding of different parts of
    Play Framework through concise code recipes based on very common use cases and
    scenarios. You will be guided through the basic concepts and abstractions used
    in Play, and we will dive into more advanced and relevant topics such as creating
    RESTful APIs, using a third-party cloud storage service to store uploaded images,
    posting messages to external message queues, and deploying Play web applications
    using Docker.
