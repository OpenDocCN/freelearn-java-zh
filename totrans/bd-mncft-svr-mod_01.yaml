- en: 'The first step to modifying Minecraft with the Bukkit API is to install a **multiplayer
    server** on your Windows PC. A **multiplayer server** is essentially the same
    as the single-player Minecraft server, but it allows for more customization and
    is not limited to the people in your home network. **Spigot** is a modified version
    of a Minecraft server, which will be used to load the **plugins** that you create.
    A **plugin** is a piece of software that hooks or plugs into another piece of
    software. The code that you will develop in this book will be in the form of plugins.
    These plugins will hook into the Minecraft code and change how Minecraft operates.
    We will set up a Spigot server and use it to test the plugins that you will write.
    By the end of this chapter, all of your friends will be able to log on to your
    modified Minecraft server and play together. By working through the following
    segments of this chapter, we will deploy a Spigot server, which will be modified
    in the later chapters:'

    The Vanilla Server is the official version of the game. It can be downloaded from
    [minecraft.net](http://minecraft.net) and is typically named `minecraft_server.jar`
    or `minecraft_server.exe`. The vanilla server currently does not support any sort

    us to the next term. **CraftBukkit** is a modified Minecraft server that replaces
    the vanilla server. CraftBukkit and vanilla Minecraft provide us with essentially
    the same game. The difference is that CraftBukkit has the ability to load Bukkit
    plugins and execute the code within the game. CraftBukkit translates the Bukkit
    methods and variables into Minecraft code, which was developed by Mojang. CraftBukkit
    also includes additional code to aid plugin developers with completing certain
    tasks, such as saving/loading data, listening for server events, and scheduling
    the code that needs to be executed. We will not mention CraftBukkit much in this
    book, because it has been replaced with a project named **Spigot**.

    does. Spigot was built on top of the CraftBukkit project. Therefore, they share
    a lot of the same code. However, Spigot is more configurable via its settings;
    in many ways, it is much faster. The Spigot team now maintains all three of the
    projects, namely Bukkit, CraftBukkit, and Spigot. You will be able to use either
    CraftBukkit or Spigot to run a server, since the Spigot team has been kind enough
    to provide us with both. I recommend running the Spigot server for the reasons
    mentioned earlier.'

    team updates the `spigot.jar` file as Mojang releases new versions of Minecraft.

    the server from losing the changes that were made in the game in case it crashes
    or shuts down for some reason, such as the computer losing power. Vanilla has
    set this to `6000` by default. This value is provided in **ticks**. There are
    20 **ticks** every second. We can determine how long 6,000 ticks is with this
    math: 6000 ticks / 20 ticks/second = 300 seconds and 300 seconds / 60 seconds/minute
    = 5 minutes. From this calculation, you should be able to calculate an appropriate
    time period after which you want your server to autosave your progress. If your
    server lags whenever it saves your changes, then you may want to increase this
    number. A setting of `72000` will cause a lag only once every hour. However, if
    the server crashes right before it saves, you may lose any progress that you made
    in the past hour.'

- en: Where's the fun in running your own Minecraft server when no one else can log
    on to it? I will now explain how to allow your friends to connect to your server
    so that they can play with you. In order to do this, we must first find your IP
    address. Just like your place of residence has a street address, your computer
    has an address on the Internet. This is what your friends will type into their
    Minecraft client to find your server. To find the IP address, simply search `IP`
    on Google. At the top of the results will be a line that states, "**Your public
    IP address is XX.XX.XXX.XX"** (the X signs will be replaced by numbers, and its
    overall length may be different). You can also visit [www.whatismyip.com](http://www.whatismyip.com)
    to find out your IP address.

- en: Once you have your IP address, try using it to connect to your server rather
    than using `localhost`. If you are able to connect, then your friends will be
    able to do so too. If not, you will have to take additional steps to allow other
    players to connect to your server. This will be the case if your computer is attached
    to a router. We must let the router know that it should point other Minecraft
    players towards your computer, which is running the server. This process is called
    **port forwarding.** To do so, we will first need some additional information.

    highlighted. The numbers will most likely be very similar to these sample numbers.
    **IPv4 Address** is the address of your computer, and **Default Gateway** is the
    address of your router. Make a note of both of these IPs.
  id: totrans-115

    the router, which is **192.168.1.1** in our example. If you do this correctly,
    then you will be prompted with a login form asking for a username and password.
    If you do not know this information, you can try to input `admin` for both the
    fields. If this is unsuccessful, you will have to find the default username and
    password, which can be found in the paperwork that was provided with your router.
    This information can usually be found online as well by searching for the name
    of your router along with the term `default login.`

    to look for a tab that says something that includes the terms **Forwarding**,
    **Port Forward**, or **Applications & Gaming**. If you do not see any of these,
    then expand your search by exploring the advanced settings. Once you find the
    correct page, you will most likely see a table that looks like the following one:'

    will of course differ depending on your router, but the important details are
    that you forward port `25565` to the IP address that you found earlier, which
    is **192.168.1.100** in our example. Ensure that you save these new settings.
    If you have done this correctly, then you should now be able to connect to the
    server by using your public IP address.
