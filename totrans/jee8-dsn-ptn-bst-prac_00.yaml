- en: Over time, the world of enterprise has invested more and more in technologies
    and applications that optimize processes and help businesses increase their profits
    and improve services or products. The enterprise environment has challenges that
    need to be faced to implement good solutions, such as the high availability of
    services, the capacity to change when needed, the capacity to scale services,
    and the capacity to process a large amount of data. With this, new applications
    have been created to optimize processes and increase profits. The Java language
    and Java EE are great tools for creating an application for the enterprise environment,
    because, Java language is multiplatform, open source, widely tested, and has a
    strong community and a strong ecosystem. Furthermore, the Java language has Java
    EE, which is, an umbrella of specifications that permit us developer enterprise
    application without depending on vendors. The development of enterprise application
    has some well-known problems that occur over and over. These problems involve
    the integration of services, the high availability of applications, and resilience.

    to develop enterprise applications using Java EE 8 best practices. Furthermore,
    this book will demonstrate how we can use design patterns and enterprise patterns
    with Java EE 8, and how we can optimize our solutions using aspect-oriented programming,
    reactive programming, and microservices with Java EE 8\. Throughout this book,
    we learn about integration patterns, reactive patterns, security patterns, deployment
    patterns, and operational patterns. At the end of this book, we will have an overview
    of MicroProfile and how it can help us develop applications using microservices
    architecture.
