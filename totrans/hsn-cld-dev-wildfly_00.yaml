    use to develop and deploy Java EE applications in the cloud. You will be led through
    the whole application development process: creating the application, deploying
    in the cloud, configuring Continuous Integration, and secure and fault-tolerant
    communication between the created services. As a result, you will gain practical
    knowledge of Java EE cloud development, which you can use as a reference for your
    further projects.'

    Architectural Methodologies*, gives users an overview of the current state of
    Java EE and its relevance to modern architectural methodologies, that is, microservices
    and cloud computing. We will introduce the tools that will be used throughout
    the book and the application that we will be developing.'

    with WildFly Swarm*, covers WildFly and how it relates to Java EE and its main
    features. We will introduce WildFly Swarm—WildFly''s side project—describe its
    purpose, and show how it can be used to develop microservices.'

    Services*, focuses on what Swarm does to create your services with only those
    dependencies that are necessary for them. You will learn in greater detail what
    a fraction is, how Swarm detects which fractions should be used, and how you can
    modify the fraction discovery behavior.'
