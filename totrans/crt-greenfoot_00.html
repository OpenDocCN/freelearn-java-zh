Unlike other texts, which start with a detailed description of all aspects of a language or development platform, we will only cover exactly what is needed for the task at hand. As you progress through the book, your programming skill and ability will grow as you learn topics such as animation, collision detection, artificial intelligence, and game design. Project-based learning is a proven approach and becoming prominent in primary, secondary, and higher education. It enhances the learning process and improves knowledge retention.</p><p>The topics presented in this book closely follow the ones I cover in my game design class. Through years of teaching this material, I have found that a project-based learning approach can quickly get students successfully programming and creating interesting games and applications. I hope that you too will be amazed with how much you can accomplish in a short amount of time.</p><p>We will code our games in Java. Java is one of the most popular and powerful programming languages in the world and is widely used in the finance industry, gaming companies, and research institutions. We will be doing our programming in Greenfoot (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.greenfoot.org">www.greenfoot.org</a>)—an interactive Java development environment. This environment allows both novice and experienced programmers to quickly create visually appealing applications. It provides a safe environment for experimentation and allows you to share your work on a variety of platforms.</p><p>To get the most out of this book, you should:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem">Open Greenfoot and code as you are reading the book</li><li class="listitem">Experiment with the code you have after completing a chapter</li><li class="listitem">Know that some details not covered in a chapter will be addressed in an upcoming chapter</li><li class="listitem">Be proud of your accomplishments and share them with friends, family, and the Greenfoot community</li></ul></div><p>Learning is not a passive activity. Dig into each chapter and experiment, add your own unique twists, and then code something uniquely your own. I can't wait to see what you can do.</p><div class="section" title="What this book covers"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl1sec02"/>What this book covers</h1></div></div></div><p><a class="link" title="Chapter 1. Let's Dive Right in…" href="part0014.xhtml">Chapter 1</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Let's Dive Right in…</em></span>, takes you through a complete tutorial for creating a simple game complete with an introduction screen, game over screen, a score, mouse input, and sound. This tutorial serves the purpose of introducing you to Greenfoot basics, Java basics, and good programming practices.</p><p><a class="link" title="Chapter 2. Animation" href="part0017.xhtml">Chapter 2</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Animation</em></span>, discusses how to perform animation in Greenfoot. Animation requires appropriate and well-timed image swapping as well as realistic movement around the screen. After reading the given topic and seeing an example, you will apply learned animation techniques to the game you created in <a class="link" title="Chapter 1. Let's Dive Right in…" href="part0014.xhtml">Chapter 1</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Let's Dive Right in…</em></span>.</p><p><a class="link" title="Chapter 3. Collision Detection" href="part0024.xhtml">Chapter 3</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Collision Detection</em></span>, discusses why collision detection is necessary for most simulations and games. You will learn how to use Greenfoot's built-in collision detection mechanisms and then learn more accurate methods to do collision detection. You will use both border-based and hidden-sprite methods of collision detection to create a zombie invasion simulation.</p><p><a class="link" title="Chapter 4. Projectiles" href="part0030.xhtml">Chapter 4</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Projectiles</em></span>, talks about how actors in creative Greenfoot often have movement that can best be described as <span class="emphasis"><em>being launched</em></span>. A soccer ball, bullet, laser, light ray, baseball, and firework are examples of this type of object. You will learn how to implement this type of propelled movement. You will also learn how gravity, if present, affects it by working through the implementation of a comprehensive platform game.</p><p><a class="link" title="Chapter 5. Interactive Application Design and Theory" href="part0034.xhtml">Chapter 5</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Interactive Application Design and Theory</em></span>, discusses creating engaging and immersive experiences in Greenfoot, which is far more involved than compiling a collection of programming effects into one application. In this chapter, you will learn how to engage your user by understanding the relationship between user choice and outcome, conditioning the user, and including the right level of complexity into your work. You will be shown a proven iterative development process that helps you put the theory into practice.</p><p><a class="link" title="Chapter 6. Scrolling and Mapped Worlds" href="part0042.xhtml">Chapter 6</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Scrolling and Mapped Worlds</em></span>, discusses how to create worlds that are much more extensive than the ones that can fit into the confines of a single screen. At the beginning of the chapter, you will code a scrolling exploration game and by the end of the chapter you will expand it into a large mapped game.</p><p><a class="link" title="Chapter 7. Artificial Intelligence" href="part0047.xhtml">Chapter 7</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Artificial Intelligence</em></span>, talks about how AI, despite being a deep and complex topic, has some simple techniques you can learn to give the illusion of having intelligent, autonomous actors in your worlds. First, you will learn how to effectively use random behaviors. Next, you will implement simple heuristics to simulate intelligent behavior. Last, you will learn the A* search algorithm to allow game actors to intelligently bypass obstacles when moving between two locations on the screen.</p><p><a class="link" title="Chapter 8. User Interfaces" href="part0050.xhtml">Chapter 8</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>User Interfaces</em></span>, discusses adding an interface to your Greenfoot scenarios. In this chapter, you will learn how to communicate with your user through buttons, labels, menus, and a heads-up display.</p><p><a class="link" title="Chapter 9. Gamepads in Greenfoot" href="part0056.xhtml">Chapter 9</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Gamepads in Greenfoot</em></span>, discusses the capabilities of a gamepad device and then teaches you how to set up Greenfoot to work with it. You will then add gamepad support to the game we created in <a class="link" title="Chapter 1. Let's Dive Right in…" href="part0014.xhtml">Chapter 1</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Let's Dive Right in…</em></span>, and <a class="link" title="Chapter 2. Animation" href="part0017.xhtml">Chapter 2</a>,<span class="emphasis"><em> Animation</em></span>.</p><p><a class="link" title="Chapter 10. What to Dive into Next…" href="part0063.xhtml">Chapter 10</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>What to Dive into Next…</em></span>, gives you an opportunity to reflect on the skills you learned during the course of this book. I then go on to suggest projects you should attempt in order to continue your journey as a programmer and interactive application author.</p></div></div>
