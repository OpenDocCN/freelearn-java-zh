    to centralize managing the configuration of our microservices. As already described
    in *Chapter 1*, *Introduction to Microservices*, an increased number of microservices
    typically comes with an increased number of configuration files that need to be
    managed and updated.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: With the Spring Cloud Config Server, we can place the configuration files for
    all our microservices in a central configuration repository, which will make it
    much easier to handle them. Our microservices will be updated to retrieve their
    configuration from the configuration server at startup.

- en: By default, a client connects first to the config server to retrieve its configuration.
    Based on the configuration, it connects to the discovery server, Netflix Eureka
    in our case, to register itself. It is also possible to do this the other way
    around, that is, the client first connects to the discovery server to find a config
    server instance and then connects to the config server to get its configuration.
    There are pros and cons to both approaches.
  prefs: []

    can become a single point of failure. If the clients connect first to a discovery
    server, such as Netflix Eureka, there can be multiple config server instances
    registered so that a single point of failure can be avoided. When we learn about
    the **service** concept in Kubernetes later on in this book, starting with *Chapter
    15*, *Introduction to Kubernetes*, we will see how we can avoid a single point
    of failure by running multiple containers, for example, config servers, behind
    each Kubernetes service.

    This means that we need to secure the configuration information both in transit
    and at rest. From a runtime perspective, the config server does not need to be
    exposed to the outside through the edge server. During development, however, it
    is useful to be able to access the API of the config server to check the configuration.
    In production environments, it is recommended to lock down external access to
    the config server.

    can steal sensitive information, such as passwords, the config server supports
    the encryption of configuration information when stored on disk. The config server
    supports the use of both symmetric and asymmetric keys. Asymmetric keys are more
    secure but harder to manage.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In this chapter, we will use a symmetric key. The symmetric key is given to
    the config server at startup by specifying an environment variable, `ENCRYPT_KEY`.
    The encrypted key is just a plain text string that needs to be protected in the
    same way as any sensitive information.

- en: In this chapter, we have seen how we can use the Spring Cloud Config Server
    to centralize managing the configuration of our microservices. We can place the
    configuration files in a common configuration repository and share common configurations
    in a single configuration file while keeping microservice-specific configuration
    in microservice-specific configuration files. The microservices have been updated
    to retrieve their configuration from the config server at startup and are configured
    to handle temporary outages while retrieving their configuration from the config
    server.

- en: The config server can protect configuration information by requiring authenticated
    usage of its API with HTTP basic authentication and can prevent eavesdropping
    by exposing its API externally through the edge server that uses HTTPS. To prevent
    intruders who obtained access to the configuration files on disk from gaining
    access to sensitive information such as passwords, we can use the config server
    `/encrypt` endpoint to encrypt the information and store it encrypted on disk.

    they should be locked down before use in production.
