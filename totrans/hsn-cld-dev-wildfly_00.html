<p class="western">The mission of the book is to make you familiar with the tools that you can use to develop and deploy Java EE applications in the cloud. You will be led through the whole application development process: creating the application, deploying in the cloud, configuring Continuous Integration, and secure and <span>fault-tolerant communication between the created services</span>. As a result, you will gain practical knowledge of Java EE cloud development, which you can use as a reference for your further projects.</p>

<p><a href="77a69da4-3aff-46c3-aa00-fa4d02db5061.xhtml">Chapter 1</a>, <em>Java EE and Modern Architectural Methodologies</em>,<span> gives users an overview of the current state </span>of Java EE and its relevance to modern architectural methodologies, that is, microservices and cloud computing<span>. We will introduce the tools that will be used throughout the book and the application that we will be developing.</span></p>
<p><a href="c00cfc93-f395-446e-9132-242f02216783.xhtml">Chapter 2</a>, <em>Getting Familiar with WildFly Swarm</em>,<span> covers WildFly and how it relates to Java EE and its main features. We will introduce WildFly Swarm—WildFly's side project—describe its purpose, and show how it can be used to develop microservices. </span></p>
<p><a href="dd01a81c-3ad7-4b3b-80fa-a8af1b89581c.xhtml">Chapter 3</a>, <em>Right-Sizing Your Services</em>,<span> focuses on what Swarm does to create your services with only those dependencies that are necessary for them. You will learn in greater detail what a fraction</span><span> is</span><span>, how Swarm detects which fractions should be used, and how you can modify the fraction discovery behavior. </span></p>
<p><a href="d76eaa85-5053-41f6-bcd1-307db5a17f60.xhtml">Chapter 4</a>, <em>Tuning the Configuration of Your Services</em>,<span> helps you to learn how to configure your Swarm services. We will show you practical examples of different configuration tools that are available and how you can use them to steer the behavior of your applications.</span></p>
<p><a href="c1be724d-e5fd-4c33-bd27-c04887d5cc8e.xhtml">Chapter 5</a>, <em>Testing Your Services with Arquillian</em>,  teaches you how to test your microservices. This chapter will introduce Arquillian, the testing framework that will be used, and present the purpose of the project and its main features. Later, you will learn how to develop, write, and configure tests for your services based on practical examples.</p>
<p><a href="461aee71-984a-4158-addc-fc49341d3455.xhtml">Chapter 6</a>, <em>Deploying Applications on the Cloud with OpenShift</em>, <span>discusses how to deploy those services to the cloud, and this chapter uses OpenShift to achieve that.</span></p>
<p><a href="d8bc5d6c-476e-45cf-b282-67388834947a.xhtml">Chapter 7</a>, <em>Configuring Storage for Your Applications</em>, starts by helping you learn the theoretical basis of OpenShift storage configuration. Later, we will show you how to deploy a database in the cloud and configure your cloud applications to use it.</p>
<p><a href="988f96cb-b157-41a0-8c0c-81c5ec440927.xhtml">Chapter 8</a>, <em>Scaling and Connecting Your Services</em>, looks in greater detail at the process of deploying, scaling, and connecting your applications running in an OpenShift environment.</p>
<p><a href="e5cfc996-0fbf-40e8-a89b-fc9ee72c8861.xhtml">Chapter 9</a>, <em>Configuring Continuous Integration Using Jenkins</em>, teaches you how to integrate the pet store application with Jenkins, a Continuous Integration server. We will introduce CI concepts and show how they can be implemented using Jenkins.</p>
<p><span><a href="2ad0780e-aeb3-40a8-8af7-f2d26341bb35.xhtml">Chapter 10</a>, <em>Providing Security Using Keycloak</em>, deals with the basics of distributed, token-based security. We will introduce Keycloak, an authentication server, that can be used to secure distributed cloud applications. As a practical example, we will secure part of the API of the Petstore application.</span></p>
<p><span><a href="4a84b845-356b-47f8-98b8-b80c3bed16e6.xhtml">Chapter 11</a>, <em>Adding Resilience Using Hystrix</em>, discusses how to deal with network failures, which are inevitable in a distributed environment. In order to do that, we will introduce the circuit breaker architectural pattern and cover when it should be used and what are its benefits. We will look at its Netflix implementation, Hystrix. We will cover how it is implemented and how it can be used.</span></p>
<p><a href="9920ab21-5983-4d44-b8e5-0d08bb4e0717.xhtml">Chapter 12</a>, <em>Future Direction</em>, describes briefly what the future of Java EE development is likely to look such as, the plans for evolving the platform and how concepts provided by applications described in the book may be standardized in the future. We will also take a look at MicroProfile and Jakarta EE, describe their purpose, and emphasize how they can help you to move the platform forward at a faster pace.</p>

<p>This book assumes that you are familiar with Java EE technology. Although we will be briefly reminding what Java EE constructs do in the examples, they won't be explained in detail.</p>
<p>The code repository contains the examples from all the chapters. In order to help you navigate through them, the examples are indexed from within the chapters.</p>

            <article>
                
<p>There are a number of text conventions used throughout this book.</p>
<p><kbd>CodeInText</kbd>: <span>Indicates c</span>ode words in text, database table names, folder names, filenames, file extensions, pathnames, dummy URLs, user input, and Twitter handles. <span>Here is an example:</span> "<span>Computer programming books often start with a </span><kbd>Hello World</kbd><span> application</span>."</p>
<p>A block of code is set as follows:</p>
<pre><span>package </span>org.packt.swarm<span>;<br/></span><span><br/></span><span>import </span>javax.ws.rs.<span>GET</span><span>;<br/></span><span>import </span>javax.ws.rs.<span>Path</span><span>;<br/></span><span>import </span>javax.ws.rs.<span>Produces</span><span>;<br/></span></pre>
<p>When we wish to draw your attention to a particular part of a code block, the relevant lines or items are set in bold:</p>
<pre><span>package </span>org.packt.swarm<span>;<br/></span><span><br/></span><span>import </span>javax.ws.rs.<span>ApplicationPath</span><span>;<br/></span><span>import </span>javax.ws.rs.core.Application<span>;<br/></span><span><br/></span><strong>@ApplicationPath("/")</strong><br/><span>public class </span>HelloWorldApplication <span>extends </span>Application {<br/>}</pre>
<p>Any command-line input or output is written as follows:</p>
<pre><strong>mvn wildfly-swarm:run</strong></pre>
<p><strong>Bold</strong>: Indicates a new term, an important word, or w<span>ords that you see onscreen. For example, words in menus or dialog boxes appear in the text like this. Here is an example: "we have to click on the <span class="packt_screen">Create a route</span> in <span class="packt_screen">Services</span> menu of the web console.</span><span>"</span></p>
<div class="packt_infobox">Warnings or important notes appear like this.</div>
<div class="packt_tip">Tips and tricks appear like this.</div>
