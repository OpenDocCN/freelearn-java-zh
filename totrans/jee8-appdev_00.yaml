- en: Java Enterprise Edition 8, the latest version of the Java EE specification,
    adds several new features to the specification. Several existing Java EE APIs
    have seen major improvements in this version of the specification, and some brand
    new APIs have been added to Java EE. This book covers the latest versions of the
    most popular Java EE specifications, including JavaServer Faces (JSF), the Java
    Persistence API (JPA), Enterprise JavaBeans (EJB), Contexts and Dependency Injection
    (CDI), the Java API for JSON Processing (JSON-P), the new Java API for JSON Binding
    (JSON-B), the Java API for WebSocket, the Java Messaging Service (JMS) API 2.0,
    the Java API for XML Web Services (JAX-WS), and the Java API for RESTful Web Services
    (JAX-RS). It also covers securing Java EE applications via the brand new Java
    EE 8 Security API.
