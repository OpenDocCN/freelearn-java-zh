- en: Over the years, the first step in designing a Java application has usually involved
    the design of the packages and classes, as well as the interactions between them.
    It also perhaps involved designing some shared libraries. For instance, you'd
    move reusable code into a separate project and bundle it into your application
    as a JAR file. With Java 9 modules, you now have a new aspect to consider that
    significantly impacts the design process. Irrespective of whether you are creating
    a new application from scratch or you are migrating an existing classpath application
    into a modular application, there are some common questions you'll need to answer--How
    do you come up with a modular design? How do you choose what a module should be?
    How much code and functionality should be in a module? Where do you draw module
    boundaries in specific scenarios? For example, a question you might often run
    into is--Given a functionality or a set of classes and packages, should they belong
    to *Module A* or *Module B*? And how do you achieve good design principles for
    modules such as reusability, extensibility and maintainability?
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As with most software design challenges, there are no right answers that apply
    for all scenarios. In fact, some of the -ility factors pull against each other,
    and most designs involve making a calculated trade-off. However, having some guidelines
    and best practices should get us started with tackling these challenges that can
    then be refined and tweaked as per specific use cases.

- en: Among the first steps in designing and building a modular application, it helps
    to have a high level idea of what the modules and APIs will be. For simple projects,
    it can be tempting to just fire off the IDE and start coding. But for anything
    serious, it helps to spend some time and design a rough picture of the modules
    involved, their public APIs and their dependencies on each other before you start
    coding. Let's start looking at some principles and factors to keep in mind when
    designing modules and deciding what it should do.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Perhaps the most obvious way of deciding what makes a module is based on what
    it is about. In other words, its *scope*. If you were to break down any reasonably
    complex application, you'd immediately come up with high level functional areas
    that begin to separate out from each other. For instance, a banking application
    might have account related functionality that's separate from credit functionality
    and so on. In the case of existing Java applications, these different concerns
    might already be under different top-level packages. In the case of new applications,
    the various aspects of the business problem can give us clues. Distinct business
    areas stand out to form an initial high level classification, which can then perhaps
    be broken down into further chunks. So, in our banking example, account functionality
    might be split into savings and checking account functionality, account transfer
    related code, bill pay, and so on. This way of using the business concern to break
    down the application problem domain is a good strategy to get to smaller units
    that can then be good candidates for modules. You'll likely have to go through
    several levels of breaking down the scope until you arrive at a level where each
    unit feels like they could be separate modules.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Note that, while this is a good strategy to start breaking the problem in a
    top-down manner, it doesn't help you decide when to stop breaking things down!
    How do you know if your modules are too big? Or too fragmented? You'll have to
    look at other factors in this section to help make that decision.

- en: There's a popular adage in software design called **Conway's Law**, which suggests
    that the design of software in any organization is influenced by the structure
    of teams in the organization and the way they communicate with each other. It
    makes perfect sense if you think about it. Software development teams often tend
    to work on isolated libraries and code bases (or at least, code *areas*) that
    *talk* to other libraries and code bases developed by other teams. In a sense,
    there's almost a one-to-one mapping between teams and the set of code assets they
    work on. This can be a valuable factor that influences where module boundaries
    are drawn and how modules designs begin to separate from one another. Each team
    works on one or more modules, and so all the code that a given team would work
    on becomes a part of their set of modules.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This is useful for a variety of reasons. Teams can work on their code and ship
    out functionality independent of other teams. They are assigned *ownership* of
    modules, so they can handle bug fixes or code maintenance. Additionally, when
    starting out a new project, when two teams need to work on modules where one depends
    on the other, both teams can together come up with an *API contract* that they
    agree with. Then, each team can work on their modules separately and in parallel,
    although the dependent modules are not yet available.

    two different types:'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When designing modules, a good rule to try and follow is to not mix these two
    concerns. If you design modules specifically for one of the two concerns, it improves
    clarity and reuse. For example, in the address book application, the module `packt.sortutil`
    provided generic sorting ability while being completely agnostic of what it's
    sorting, thereby addresses a horizontal concern. The module `packt.addressbook`
    deals with specific address book application functionality, thereby addressing
    a vertical concern.

    a vertical concern, but it's vital when designing a module with cross-cutting
    concerns.

    layers. A typical application involves layers or tiers of functionality like the
    UI layer, business layer, data layer, and so on. That's a great way to draw some
    initial module boundaries before then looking at other categories to modularize
    further. A module should ideally not be a part of multiple application tiers.
    Sometimes, different tiers are deployed on different physical hardware. So, having
    tier separations guide module boundaries make logistical sense as well when it
    comes to deployments.

    patterns of new feature additions to your application. If most of the typical
    changes you make to your code base involves having to modify multiple modules,
    that might be a clue that your modules are too fragmented or the separation of
    modules could be better. It's OK if you are modifying multiple low-level modules
    (that is, with horizontal concerns) for an average code change or enhancement.
    But if each change or enhancement to your application requires you to modify too
    many modules with vertical concerns, you might want to re-look at the module boundaries
    and see if those different modules contain code that should ideally be together
    in the same module.

    There are some utility libraries and frameworks in Java that have made good use
    of this flexibility.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Consider the Spring Framework. Spring is a popular application framework that
    uses and orchestrates functionality across a lot of other dependent libraries
    and frameworks by scanning the classpath for available libraries that it can work
    with. If you'd like Spring to use some of these supported libraries, just dropping
    certain necessary jars into the classpath is enough for Spring to pick it up and
    use its functionality. And if you don't, the Spring framework can still function
    without them, albeit without the optional functionality.

    Now, with Java 9 and strict requirements for module dependencies, wouldn't we
    be losing this flexibility? There's no optionally dropping jars into the classpath
    anymore! Things are much more strict and controlled now. Every module that a given
    module needs should be explicitly specified with a `requires` clause in the module
    definition. Given this new state of affairs, how could you build such modules
    that are optional and with *drop-in* flexibility?

    needs to compile the code and references after all!). But it is optional at runtime.
    If the module isn't available during runtime, `java` won't complain about the
    module's unavailability like it would with the `requires` only clause. It proceeds
    with execution assuming you know what you are doing. This new feature enables
    you to have modules with a bunch of `require static` optional dependencies, which

    to you--how about using services? We've learned in [Chapter 7](part0110.html#38STS0-ed2405f4162b4f86b565edd6b6d679fb),
    *Introducing Services*, about how using services in Java modules provides a flexible
    and loosely coupled way of having modules work with each other. With services,
    you don't have to specify a readability relationship with `requires`. Modules
    that provide services are optional, not just in runtime, but also during compile
    time! So aren't services already better than optional dependencies?
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The simple answer is yes. Services are definitely the preferred way of decoupling
    modules and removing *hard* dependencies. This is what we'll examine in this pattern.
    However, they do have a problem and won't work as well as you'd imagine. Let's
    explore why.
  prefs: []

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When using services, you typically achieve abstraction by creating two types--the
    interface (which *is* the service) and the implementations of the interface (which
    are the providers of the service). You don't *have* to do this, of course. You
    can have a Java class itself be the service type. But what we are discussing now
    applies to that too.
  prefs: []

    B, you could use the previous pattern and use `requires static B` in the module
    definition of A. However, if you''d like to use services, you''ll need to assign
    one or more Java interfaces or classes as *service types*. The `module A` needs
    to specify that it `uses` these types:'

    module B exists in the module path or not! Seems simple enough, doesn't it? But
    there's a catch! Which module should the service type reside in? Is it module
    A or module B? It cannot be module B, because in that case, module A would need
    to *require* module B to access the service type in B, which defeats the whole
    purpose of making B optional! It could reside in module A, but now module B should
    depend on module A to access the service type. Thus module B `requires` A and
    module A `exports` the package containing the service type.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But wait! Our original goal was to make module A optionally depend on B. What
    we've ended up with now is module B depending on A! That seems the wrong way around,
    but if you think about the service dynamic, A is still using the implementation
    provided by B, and B is only dependent on A to get the service type. It is still
    confusing and it's not obvious what's going on just by looking at the module definitions.
    One way to solve the problem is to move the service types to a third `module C`
    which is required by both A and B. Now both A and B have access to the service
    types, and thus, are fully decoupled. This option might not always be feasible,
    and it is awkward to have a separate module just to solve this problem. But when
    it *is* possible, this approach of using services is one of the best ways to achieve
    flexibility and the *drop-anything-you-need* mechanism that exists with some libraries
    and frameworks in Java 8 and earlier.

- en: Reflection is an important feature in the Java programming language, allowing
    the ability to inspect and modify types dynamically at runtime. This is another
    feature that has been put to good use by frameworks such as Spring, Hibernate,
    and others. These frameworks use reflection to examine your classes for annotations
    and interface implementations to infer information about how to treat your code.
    You might use reflection in your own code to achieve this dynamic functionality.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: How does reflection fit into the concepts of modularity we've learned so far?
    Like we've seen before, the default behavior of strong encapsulation that protects
    types in a module from static access offers similar protection for reflective
    access as well. A Java type can be accessed through reflection if it's in a module
    that exports it, and the type calling the reflection API is in a module that reads
    the other module.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This results in a potential problem because of how reflection has been traditionally
    used in Java, especially in many of the frameworks like we've mentioned earlier.
    Frameworks like Spring expect to scan through your entire code base looking for
    classes that are annotated with certain key annotations. A lot of reflection API
    usage in Java code bases over the years have been implemented with an implicit
    understanding that the classes being reflected on are available for them to access.
    Once you move those types into modules, all the encapsulated types are effectively
    sealed off and not available for reflection. One easy solution is to expose everything!
    So, every module exposes all types that need to be accessed reflectively. But
    this is not a good idea because of the concept of the module API we've discussed
    earlier. The type that a module exposes using the `exports` clause is the module
    API. By exposing an otherwise private type just because it contains an annotation
    for the Spring framework, Hibernate, JPA, or any other such framework that uses
    reflection, we are adversely impacting the API of the module and the purpose of
    string encapsulation is defeated.
  prefs: []

    such frameworks, the platform has introduced a concept called **open modules**.
    These are a type of Java modules that still encapsulate types like we are familiar
    with, but with one major difference. The encapsulated types in these open modules
    are available for reflective access at runtime, without you having to allow compile-time
    access that an `exports` declaration would have provided.

    management. If you've dealt with build and packaging tools in the Java ecosystem
    such as Maven and Gradle, you might have come across the fact that all their library
    artifacts have version numbers associated with them. With Maven or Gradle, when

    the `google.guava` module. But you cannot specify that it depends on version `1.5.2`

    specialized modules that are easier to use but lack flexibility. A very handy
    pattern to use in such cases, when you are trying to strike that balance.

- en: 'In the sample code at `09-module-patterns/09-aggregator-and-facade-modules`,
    the module `pattern.nine.facade` acts as an aggregator and facade module that
    consolidates two separate modules--`module.one` and `module.two`. It has a transitive
    dependency on both those modules, so any module that reads `pattern.nine.facade`
    also automatically reads those two modules:'

    a class it exports--`FacadeApi` that has an example method to illustrate how a
    method can *choose* between two implementations. Here, the method chooses one
    of two implementations based on an input String value. But you can easily imagine
    facade APIs written in such a module that offer help around business rules or
    logic of your application that affects which libraries are used:'

    It can either access the library modules directly (And it can because of the transitive
    dependencies--it transitively reads both `module.one` and `module.two`). Or, it
    can call the API through the facade method to get help on which one to call. Both
    work perfectly fine, as you can see in the following code:'

    modules and identify module boundaries. When creating a new application or when
    migrating an existing legacy application to Java modules, it's always a good idea
    to have a map of the modules and their interactions designed in advance. We've
    looked at some best practices that let you figure out what a module should be
    made of and what would cause you to segregate logic into separate modules.

    of the best practices discussed previously come with simplified code examples.
    Each example is intentionally bare-bone with code that demonstrates just the pattern
    being discussed and little else, so that you can easily pick any of them up and
    tweak them further or apply them in your own code.

    that Java developers will face when moving to Java 9, migration of existing code.
    There have been years and years of Java development and tons of legacy code of
    various complexities that has been built using earlier versions of Java. How do
    we approach moving them to take advantage of Java modules? Before that, would
    they even work with Java 9? Let's begin to answer those questions, as well as
    understand what it takes to get your code read for such a migration in the next
    chapter.
