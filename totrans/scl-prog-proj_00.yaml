- en: Scala is a type-safe JVM language that incorporates **object-oriented programming**
    (**OOP**) and **functional programming** (**FP**) aspects. This book gets you
    started with the essentials of software development by guiding you through the
    different aspects of Scala programming, helping you bridge the gap between learning
    and implementing. You will learn about the unique features of Scala through diverse
    applications and encounter simple yet powerful approaches for software development.
    You will see how to use the basic tools, set up the environment, and write Scala
    programs.

- en: '*Scala Programming Projects* will help you build a number of applications,
    beginning with a simple project, such as a financial independence calculator,
    and advancing to other projects, such as a shopping application or a Bitcoin transaction
    analyzer. You will be able to use various Scala features, such as its OOP and
    FP capabilities, and learn ways to write concise, reactive, and concurrent applications
    in a type-safe manner. You will also learn how to use top-notch libraries, such
    as Akka and Play, and integrate Scala applications with Kafka, Spark, and Zeppelin;
    plus, you''ll explore deploying applications on cloud platforms.'

    Program*, explains how to set up your environment to start programming in Scala,
    covering the basic tools that are required and what the simplest Scala application
    might look like.'

    Calculator*, puts into practice the features of the Scala language seen in the
    first chapter. We will also introduce other elements of the Scala language and
    SDK to develop the model and logic for a retirement calculator. This calculator
    will help people work out how long they''ll need to save and how much they''ll
    need to save to have a comfortable retirement.'

    has you continuing to work on the retirement calculator from the previous chapter,
    handling the errors that riddle it. For instance, the calculator works correctly
    as long as the right arguments are passed to it but fails badly with a horrible
    stack trace if any of the parameters are wrong.'

    explores the more advanced features of Scala. As with any programming language,
    some advanced constructs might be seldom used in practice or can obfuscate code. We
    will aim to only explain features that we have encountered in real projects that
    have been deployed to production.'

    acronym for **Application Programming Interface**, and the acronym **REST** stands
    for **Representational State Transfer**. Basically, we will provide an interface
    for our application, so that other programs can interact with it.'
