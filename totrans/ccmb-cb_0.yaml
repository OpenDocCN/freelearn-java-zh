- en: Cucumber JVM is one of the fastest-growing tools that offer a cutting-edge platform
    to conceptualize and implement behaviour-driven development (BDD). The variety
    of features available within Cucumber bolsters and enhances experiences of implementing
    BDD for both business and development teams.

- en: This cookbook has around 40 recipes. It takes you on a learning journey, where
    you start from basic concepts such as Feature files, Step Definitions, and then
    moves on to advanced concepts such as Hooks, Tags, configuration, and integration
    with Jenkins and test automation frameworks. Each chapter has multiple recipes,
    with the first recipe introducing the main concept of that chapter; the complexity
    level of each recipe increases as you progress through the chapter. The book has
    sufficient topics for product owners, business analysts, testers, developers,
    and everyone who wants to implement BDD.
