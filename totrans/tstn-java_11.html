			<h1 id="_idParaDest-212"><a id="_idTextAnchor233"/>Documentation and Logging</h1>
			<p>In this chapter, we will look at two aspects of software development that do not directly influence the operation of the code. The <a id="_idIndexMarker788"/>first is documentation, more commonly called comments. The<a id="_idIndexMarker789"/> second is logging, a tool used to record events during the run of a program for the purpose of monitoring what the program is doing. We will begin with documenting code inline. You likely noticed that none of the code shown so far in this book has any comments. This has been done on purpose, as each chapter describes what the code is doing. If you look at the book’s code in the GitHub repository, you will find comments in <span class="No-Break">every file.</span></p>
			<p>You have probably seen a message telling you to look at the log file when something goes wrong in a program. Where do these log files come from? We will examine how we can either display messages on the console or write to a file that certain events occurred or exceptions <span class="No-Break">were thrown.</span></p>
			<p>Here is the rundown for <span class="No-Break">this chapter:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><span class="No-Break">Creating documentation</span></li>
				<li><span class="No-Break">Using logging</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>By the end of this chapter, you will understand the various ways in which comments are added to source code. You will also learn to use logging to record events in <span class="No-Break">your code.</span></p>
			<p>We will begin with documentation, but before that, let’s have a quick look at the prerequisites for <span class="No-Break">this chapter.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-213"><a id="_idTextAnchor234"/>Technical requirements</h1>
			<p>Here are the tools required to run the examples in <span class="No-Break">this chapter:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><span class="No-Break">Java 17</span></li>
				<li>A <span class="No-Break">text editor</span></li>
				<li>Maven 3.8.6 or a newer <span class="No-Break">version installed</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>The sample code for this chapter is available <span class="No-Break">at </span><a href="https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Transitioning-to-Java/tree/chapter11"><span class="No-Break">https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Transitioning-to-Java/tree/chapter11</span></a><span class="No-Break">.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-214"><a id="_idTextAnchor235"/>Creating documentation</h1>
			<p>Having been a <a id="_idIndexMarker790"/>computer science instructor for 31 years, I can tell you that the one task most students put off for as long as possible is documenting their code. I have learned of companies that forbid their developers to comment in their code. These companies believe that code should be self-documenting. If you cannot understand the purpose of the code from how it is written, then it has been written poorly. This is a big mistake. Students doing internships at such companies report spending an inordinate amount of time trying to understand the company’s <span class="No-Break">code base.</span></p>
			<p>Documenting or commenting in code is not about explaining or apologizing for writing bad code. Code carries out tasks and the task should be obvious from the code itself. What is never obvious is why the code has been constructed in a certain way and how it may fit in with the rest of the program. One question to ask yourself is whether the programmer who takes over this code base when you get promoted or you move to another company understands what you coded <span class="No-Break">and why.</span></p>
			<p>Now let us look at how we add comments to our code and the unique commenting technique available in Java, <span class="No-Break">called Javadocs.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-215"><a id="_idTextAnchor236"/>Comments</h2>
			<p>In Java, there are three ways to indicate a<a id="_idIndexMarker791"/> comment in your code. The first is the original C style comment designation, which uses an opening forward slash, then an asterisk, a closing asterisk, then a closing forward slash as a set <span class="No-Break">of characters:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
/* This is a single line comment */
/* This is a multiple line
    Java comment */</pre>
			<p>Finally, there is the inline <span class="No-Break">comment form:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
 System.out.println("Moose "/* + x */);</pre>
			<p>Here, you can use the <strong class="source-inline">/*</strong> . . . <strong class="source-inline">*/</strong> characters to comment out a section <span class="No-Break">of code.</span></p>
			<p>One important proviso is that you cannot nest these comments inside each other <span class="No-Break">as shown:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
<strong class="bold">/*</strong> Comment 1 /* Comment 2 <strong class="bold">*/</strong> end of comment 1 */</pre>
			<p>The Java compiler will see the first <strong class="source-inline">/*</strong> notation as ending at the first <strong class="source-inline">*/</strong> notation; leaving the end of the comment will likely be a <span class="No-Break">syntax error.</span></p>
			<p>The second set of characters <a id="_idIndexMarker792"/>you can use for comments is the double forward slash. These are single-line comments that end when the line ends. They can be placed anywhere and everything that follows becomes <span class="No-Break">a comment:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
// Meaningless example
int x = 4;
int z = 6;
int y = x * z; // Initializing y with x times z</pre>
			<p>These are also useful for commenting lines of code. Whenever I am making a change to an existing line of code, I first comment out the line I am replacing before I write the new line. I rarely delete code until I am certain that the new code <span class="No-Break">is working.</span></p>
			<p>There is one more way we can add comments to code and that is by <span class="No-Break">creating Javadocs.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-216"><a id="_idTextAnchor237"/>Javadocs</h2>
			<p>Javadocs are HTML pages <a id="_idIndexMarker793"/>created by the <strong class="source-inline">Javadoc</strong> tool, which is included in the Java installation. It examines every Java file and constructs an HTML page for <a id="_idIndexMarker794"/>each public class. These pages include all public fields and methods. While we will only look at this default behavior, you can adjust it. Although private elements are ignored by Javadocs, it is considered best practice to comment everything as if it <span class="No-Break">were public.</span></p>
			<p>Here is a sample program to which we will apply the Javadocs tool. The comments continue the discussion on Javadocs, so please do not skim over this but rather read it like every page in <span class="No-Break">this chapter.</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">

			<p>To run the <strong class="source-inline">javadoc</strong> tool, use the following command line <span class="No-Break">with switches:</span></p>
			<pre class="console">
javadoc -d docs</pre>
			<p>The <strong class="source-inline">-d</strong> switch is the location to <a id="_idIndexMarker795"/>which the HTML files will be written. In this case, it is assumed that there is a folder named <strong class="source-inline">docs</strong> in whatever folder you are currently in. The folder must exist, as <strong class="source-inline">javadoc</strong> will <a id="_idIndexMarker796"/>not create it. If the folder does not exist, then the HTML files will be written into the <span class="No-Break">current folder:</span></p>
			<pre class="console">
javadoc -d docs -sourcepath C:\dev\PacktJava\Transitioning-to-java\JavadocsExample\src\main\java</pre>
			<p>The <strong class="source-inline">-sourcepath</strong> switch is the path to the folder that contains either Java files or packages. As this is a Maven-based project, the packages and source files are always found in <strong class="source-inline">\src\main\java</strong> in whatever folder the Maven project <span class="No-Break">is in:</span></p>
			<pre class="console">
javadoc -d docs -sourcepath C:\dev\PacktJava\Transitioning-to-Java\JavaDocsExample\src\main\java -subpackages com:org</pre>
			<p>The last switch, <strong class="source-inline">-subpackages</strong>, is a colon-separated list of packages in the project. <strong class="source-inline">javadoc</strong> will recursively go through every folder and subfolder, starting with the names in the list, to find Java files to be <a id="_idIndexMarker797"/>processed. I created a second package that began with <strong class="source-inline">org</strong>. <strong class="source-inline">-subpackages</strong> are searched recursively and all public or package classes found in any folder starting with the listed names will <span class="No-Break">be documented.</span></p>
			<p>When the <strong class="source-inline">javadoc</strong> tool is run<a id="_idIndexMarker798"/> on the project, it will create HTML web pages. What follows is the Javadocs web page created for the <strong class="source-inline">JavaDocsExample</strong> class. It can be quite long. Take note that only public methods appear. Private methods, though commented like a public method, do not appear in the HTML output. Here is what the Javadocs will <span class="No-Break">look like.</span></p>

			<p>The entire Java library is described in Javadocs and is searchable in your browser. See <em class="italic">Further reading</em> for the URL to<a id="_idIndexMarker799"/> these docs. The best practice for the code that you write is to write Javadocs comments. This also means that you must <a id="_idIndexMarker800"/>describe what every part of your program does and, more importantly, why it does what it should. Use the <strong class="source-inline">/* . . . */</strong> and <strong class="source-inline">//</strong> notations to include additional comments in methods or temporarily <span class="No-Break">remove code.</span></p>
			<p>Now, let us look at how we can record specific events that occur in our code <span class="No-Break">using logging.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-217"><a id="_idTextAnchor239"/>Using logging</h1>
			<p>In your own code, you may <a id="_idIndexMarker801"/>want to display messages in the console while the program runs. These messages may be to inform you that an exception has been caught or record any other event that happens during the program’s execution. While you can write to the console using <strong class="source-inline">System.out.print</strong>, <strong class="source-inline">println</strong>, or my favorite, <strong class="source-inline">printf</strong>, do not. If the application is console-based, then these statements will appear with the console user interface. For GUI or web applications, the console may or may not be visible. Once the program goes into production, the end user may be confused or overwhelmed by the messages you display in <span class="No-Break">the console.</span></p>
			<p>The solution is logging. This allows you to write log messages to the console, a file, or a database, or even send them to yourself in an email. We will only look at the console or a file. Java has a logging<a id="_idIndexMarker802"/> framework, found in <strong class="source-inline">java.util.logging</strong>. We will also look at one of the external logging frameworks from the Apache Foundation, <span class="No-Break">called </span><span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">Log4j2</strong></span><span class="No-Break">.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-218"><a id="_idTextAnchor240"/>java.util.logging</h2>
			<p>There are two parts to a logging <a id="_idIndexMarker803"/>framework. There is the framework of Java classes and the configuration file. For JUL, the common name for <strong class="source-inline">java.util.logging</strong>, there is a configuration file named <strong class="source-inline">logging.properties</strong> in the <strong class="source-inline">conf</strong> folder of the Java installation. We will see how to use a custom config file rather than use the config shared by all applications. The default location for the JUL config is in the Java <strong class="source-inline">conf</strong> folder. We can place our JUL custom properties file anywhere on our system, as we must provide the path to the file when we instantiate <span class="No-Break">the logger.</span></p>
			<p>Here is a simple program that uses <span class="No-Break">the logger:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
public class JULDemoDefaultConfig {</pre>
			<p>We instantiate <strong class="source-inline">Logger</strong> using the Factory Software pattern as implemented in the <strong class="source-inline">Logger</strong> class. We pass the name of this class so that it can appear in the logger output and we can support different <strong class="source-inline">Logger</strong> items for <span class="No-Break">different classes:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
    private static final Logger LOG =
    Logger.getLogger(JULDemoDefaultConfig.class.getName());</pre>
			<p>Log messages must be associated with a level, which is the first parameter when we use the <strong class="source-inline">log</strong> method. There are six levels, and all have an optional third parameter of an <strong class="source-inline">Exception</strong> object. Typically, the <strong class="source-inline">Level.INFO</strong> parameter is used for recording information that you wish to record about what the program is doing or who is doing it. <strong class="source-inline">Level.SEVERE</strong> is used for recording exceptions. The <strong class="source-inline">FINEST</strong>, <strong class="source-inline">FINER</strong>, and <strong class="source-inline">FINE</strong> parameters are used while debugging an application. You can decide the minimum level in the config file. During development, you will use <strong class="source-inline">ALL</strong>, while once put into production you will, raise the<a id="_idIndexMarker804"/> level to <strong class="source-inline">INFO</strong>. This means that you do not need to delete or comment out log messages <span class="No-Break">below </span><span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">INFO</strong></span><span class="No-Break">.</span></p>
			<p>In this method, we just create <span class="No-Break">log messages:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
    public void perform() {
        LOG.log(Level.FINEST,
            "JUL default-Using LOG.log at Level.FINEST");
        LOG.log(Level.FINER,
            "JUL default-Using LOG.log at Level.FINER");
        LOG.log(Level.FINE,
            "JUL default-Using LOG.log at Level.FINE");
        LOG.log(Level.INFO,
            "JUL default-Using LOG.log at Level.INFO");
        LOG.log(Level.WARNING,
            "JUL default-Using LOG.log at Level.WARNING");</pre>
			<p>For the <strong class="source-inline">SEVERE</strong> level, I have forced an exception in the <strong class="source-inline">try</strong> block and when it is caught, I log it by including the <span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">Exception</strong></span><span class="No-Break"> object.</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
        try {</pre>
			<p>You can add a custom message to an exception by passing a <strong class="source-inline">String</strong> object to <span class="No-Break">the constructor:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
            throw new Exception(
                   "JUL default config exception");
        } catch (Exception ex) {
            LOG.log(Level.SEVERE,
          "JUL default-Using LOG.log at Level.SEVERE", ex);
        }
    }
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        new JULDemoDefaultConfig().perform();
    }
}</pre>
			<p>If you have a custom config file, you must <a id="_idIndexMarker805"/>explicitly load the file; otherwise, the default config, <strong class="source-inline">logging.properties</strong>, in the Java <strong class="source-inline">conf</strong> folder will be used. It is not a good idea to change the default configuration, as it will affect every program that you run that <span class="No-Break">uses JUL.</span></p>
			<p>To load a custom config file, you need to <span class="No-Break">find this:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
private static final Logger LOG =
    Logger.getLogger(JULDemoDefaultConfig.class.getName());</pre>
			<p>Replace it with <span class="No-Break">the following:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
private static final Logger LOG;
static {</pre>
			<p>When your code is packaged into a JAR file, the location of resource files that existed in <strong class="source-inline">src/main/resources</strong> is the root of the project. The <strong class="source-inline">retrieveURLOfJarResource</strong> method knows this, so it can load the config file placed in this folder. This is in a <strong class="source-inline">static</strong> initialization block, which will ensure that this <strong class="source-inline">Logger</strong> class will only be instantiated once should there be more than one instance of <span class="No-Break">this class:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
    try (InputStream is =
            retrieveURLOfJarResource("logging.properties").
            openStream()) {
        LogManager.getLogManager().readConfiguration(is);
    } catch (Exception e) {
        Logger.getAnonymousLogger().severe(
              "Unable to load config\nProgram is exiting");
        System.exit(1);
     }
     LOG = Logger.getLogger(
         JULDemoCustomConfig.class.getName());
    }</pre>
			<p>The default <strong class="source-inline">logging.properties</strong> file is very well commented. Here are the contents of the file with the comments<a id="_idIndexMarker806"/> removed. I encourage you to examine the version of this file on <span class="No-Break">your machine.</span></p>
			<p>Here’s the display output to <span class="No-Break">the console:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
handlers= java.util.logging.ConsoleHandler</pre>
			<p>Unless it's overridden, this will only show logs of this level <span class="No-Break">or greater:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
.level= INFO</pre>
			<p>If you are writing logs to a file, then the <strong class="source-inline">pattern</strong> property is the folder and filename. In this case, <strong class="source-inline">%h</strong> means to write the file to your home directory. This is the best practice for JUL. If you prefer to store the log files in a specific folder name, then it must <span class="No-Break">already exist:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
java.util.logging.FileHandler.pattern = %h/java%u.log
java.util.logging.FileHandler.limit = 50000</pre>
			<p>Every time the program runs, it overwrites the previous log file, as only one log file <span class="No-Break">is permitted:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
java.util.logging.FileHandler.count = 1</pre>
			<p>Logging is thread-safe. This tells us that up to 100 concurrent log file locks can be used. If you get <strong class="source-inline">IOException</strong> errors when writing to a log, you may solve this issue by increasing the number <span class="No-Break">of locks:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
java.util.logging.FileHandler.maxLocks = 100</pre>
			<p>Write to the log file in the <span class="No-Break">XML format:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
java.util.logging.FileHandler.formatter =
                java.util.logging.XMLFormatter</pre>
			<p>Overriding a handler’s level supersedes the <span class="No-Break">global level:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
java.util.logging.ConsoleHandler.level = INFO</pre>
			<p>This is the format of the log when displayed on the screen. You can configure <strong class="source-inline">SimpleFormatter</strong>, and this is<a id="_idIndexMarker807"/> explained in the comments for the default <span class="No-Break">config file:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
java.util.logging.ConsoleHandler.formatter =
                java.util.logging.SimpleFormatter</pre>
			<p>The custom properties file has the <span class="No-Break">following changes:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li>The <strong class="source-inline">FileHandler</strong> class has been added so that logs will be written to a file and <span class="No-Break">the console:</span><pre class="source-code">
handlers= java.util.logging.FileHandler,
          java.util.logging.ConsoleHandler</pre></li>
				<li>Both handlers will now display log messages of <span class="No-Break">every level:</span><pre class="source-code">
java.util.logging.ConsoleHandler.level = ALL
java.util.logging.FileHandler.level = ALL</pre></li>
			</ul>
			<p>We use <strong class="source-inline">%h</strong> to indicate that we want the logs written to our home directory. If you wish to write them to a specific folder, then the folder must already exist. If the folder does not exist, then the file will not <span class="No-Break">be created:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
java.util.logging.FileHandler.pattern =
                          %h/loggingdemo-JUL_%g.log</pre>
			<p>There can be three log files, one for each run of the program. After writing to the third log file, should there need to be another log file, then it wraps around and overwrites the existing files in the order they <span class="No-Break">were created:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
java.util.logging.FileHandler.count = 3</pre>
			<p>The Java logger is always available and does not have any dependencies that you must add to the Maven POM file. Logging can have an impact on the performance of your code. For this reason, there<a id="_idIndexMarker808"/> are alternatives to JUL that execute in less time or provide features not present in JUL. Let's look at one of the most widely used external <span class="No-Break">loggers, Log4j2.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-219"><a id="_idTextAnchor241"/>Log4j2</h2>
			<p>Log4j2 works<a id="_idIndexMarker809"/> very much like JUL. Before we can use it, we need to add new dependencies to our <a id="_idIndexMarker810"/><span class="No-Break">POM file:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
        &lt;dependency&gt;
            &lt;groupId&gt;org.apache.logging.log4j&lt;/groupId&gt;
            &lt;artifactId&gt;log4j-api&lt;/artifactId&gt;
            &lt;version&gt;2.19.0&lt;/version&gt;
        &lt;/dependency&gt;
        &lt;dependency&gt;
            &lt;groupId&gt;org.apache.logging.log4j&lt;/groupId&gt;
            &lt;artifactId&gt;log4j-core&lt;/artifactId&gt;
            &lt;version&gt;2.19.0&lt;/version&gt;
        &lt;/dependency&gt;</pre>
			<p>In any file in which you plan to use Log4j2, you begin with this <span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">class</strong></span><span class="No-Break"> field:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
private static final Logger LOG =
                LogManager.getLogger(Log4jDemo.class);</pre>
			<p>Now to be able to log, you just need the following. Take note that the levels are now methods of the <strong class="source-inline">LOG</strong> object. An optional second parameter can take an <strong class="source-inline">Exception</strong> reference for all levels, as shown in <span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">Level 5</strong></span><span class="No-Break">:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
    public void perform() {
        LOG.trace("log4j2-Level 1: I am a trace");
        LOG.debug("log4j2-Level 2: I am a debug");
        LOG.info("log4j2-Level 3: I am an info");
        LOG.warn("log4j2-Level 4: I am a warning");
        try {
            throw new Exception("log4j2 exception");
        } catch (Exception ex) {
            LOG.error("log4j2-Level 5: I am an error", ex);
        }</pre>
			<p>When using Log4j2, you should create a config file, as its default behavior<a id="_idIndexMarker811"/> is limited. In the<a id="_idIndexMarker812"/> absence of this file, the logger will do nothing. Like JUL’s config, the <strong class="source-inline">log4j2.xml</strong> config file is expected to be found <span class="No-Break">in </span><span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">src/main/resources</strong></span><span class="No-Break">.</span></p>
			<p>Rather than review this file, I ask you to clone the repo from GitHub for this chapter and look at the <strong class="source-inline">log4j2.xml</strong> file in the <strong class="source-inline">LoggingExample</strong> project. Its comments explain what can be configured. One improvement over JUL is that should you wish to store the logs in an arbitrary folder, Log4j2’s file handler will create <span class="No-Break">the folder.</span></p>
			<p>I add a logger to almost every file I write. This allows me to write logs as needed. Declaring a <strong class="source-inline">Logger</strong> object that you do not use will have no effect on the performance of <span class="No-Break">your program.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-220"><a id="_idTextAnchor242"/>Summary</h1>
			<p>In this chapter, we covered two important tasks that every programmer should include in their code, regardless of the language used. The first was documentation. Comments and Javadocs can be critical in the maintenance of existing code or in adding new features. You may think you will never forget why you coded in a certain way, but 6 months from now, that memory may not be as accurate as it needs <span class="No-Break">to be.</span></p>
			<p>During the development of software, and once it goes into production, having the program write what it is doing to the console, or more commonly, to a file, can go a long way in tracking down bugs. Auditing software that is subject to regulations is another task logging can carry out. Never use <strong class="source-inline">System.out.print</strong> or its cousins to display information about the operation of a program – use a logger. Either the Java logger or an external logger such as Log4j2 should be, must be deployed in <span class="No-Break">your code.</span></p>
			<p>Documenting your code is mandatory. Using logging to record events in a program is mandatory. Remember that programming is an engineering discipline and not an art form. Engineering requires the type of documentation described here and requires the use of logging to monitor a <span class="No-Break">program’s performance.</span></p>
			<p>Coming up, we will look at how to work with floating-point numbers when absolute accuracy is required. Testing our code to ensure it performs as designed is also covered in the <span class="No-Break">next chapter.</span></p>
