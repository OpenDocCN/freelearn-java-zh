			<h1 id="_idParaDest-20"><a id="_idTextAnchor019"/>Getting Started with Java</h1>
			<p>Welcome to the exciting world of Java! Java<a id="_idIndexMarker000"/> is a very popular programming language. It is a multipurpose, powerful, and popular programming language that has been used by millions of developers worldwide to create a wide variety of applications. And yes, it really is multipurpose since it can be used to create all sorts of applications, from web and mobile apps to game development <span class="No-Break">and beyond.</span></p>
			<p>So, you’ve done a great job choosing a (new) language. We’re going to take you on a (hopefully) fascinating journey that will provide you with valuable skills and open new opportunities in the ever-evolving field <span class="No-Break">of technology.</span></p>
			<p>What are we waiting for? In this chapter, we’re going to cover the following <span class="No-Break">main topics:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><span class="No-Break">Java features</span></li>
				<li><span class="No-Break">Installing Java</span></li>
				<li>Compiling and running <span class="No-Break">Java programs</span></li>
				<li>Working with an <strong class="bold">integrated development </strong><span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">environment</strong></span><span class="No-Break"> (</span><span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">IDE</strong></span><span class="No-Break">)</span></li>
				<li>Creating and running a program with <span class="No-Break">an IDE</span></li>
			</ul>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-21"><a id="_idTextAnchor020"/>Technical requirements</h1>
			<p>Before diving into the magical world of Java programming, let’s ensure you have the right hardware. If your hardware doesn’t meet these requirements, don’t worry; online alternatives are discussed later in this chapter. If you are using your work laptop, make sure that you have download rights. Here’s a brief overview of <span class="No-Break">the requirements:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Operating system</strong>: Java can run on<a id="_idIndexMarker001"/> various operating systems, including Windows, macOS, and Linux. Ensure that you have a recent version of one of these operating systems installed on <span class="No-Break">your computer.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Java Development Kit</strong> (<strong class="bold">JDK</strong>): To<a id="_idIndexMarker002"/> compile and run Java programs, you’ll need the JDK installed on your system. The JDK includes the <strong class="bold">Java Runtime Environment</strong> (<strong class="bold">JRE</strong>), which<a id="_idIndexMarker003"/> contains the necessary libraries and components for running Java applications. We’ll see how to install <span class="No-Break">this later.</span></li>
				<li> <strong class="bold">System resources</strong>: More is always better, but Java<a id="_idIndexMarker004"/> isn’t too demanding. It doesn’t require high-end hardware, but it’s still a good idea to have a system with sufficient resources for a smooth development experience. The following are the minimum and recommended <span class="No-Break">system requirements:</span><ul><li><span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">Minimum requirements</strong></span><span class="No-Break">:</span><ul><li>CPU: 1 GHz or <span class="No-Break">faster processor</span></li><li>RAM: <span class="No-Break">2 GB</span></li><li>Disk space: 1 GB (for JDK installation and <span class="No-Break">additional files)</span></li></ul></li><li><span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">Recommended requirements</strong></span><span class="No-Break">:</span><ul><li>CPU: 2 GHz or faster <span class="No-Break">multi-core processor</span></li><li>RAM: 4 GB <span class="No-Break">or more</span></li><li>Disk space: 2 GB or more (for JDK installation, additional files, <span class="No-Break">and projects)</span></li></ul></li></ul></li>
			</ul>
			<p>Keep in mind that these requirements may change with future updates to the JDK and related tools. We have placed the files in a GitHub repository. You can clone the projects with the use of Git and import them to your computer this way. It’s beyond the scope of explaining how to use Git here but it’s recommended to look into it independently. You can access the files and examples used in this book <span class="No-Break">here: </span><a href="https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Learn-Java-with-Projects"><span class="No-Break">https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Learn-Java-with-Projects</span></a><span class="No-Break">.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-22"><a id="_idTextAnchor021"/>Exploring Java features</h1>
			<p>Java was developed<a id="_idIndexMarker005"/> by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems in the mid-1990s. When Java was created, it was originally designed as a language for consumer electronics. It attempted to support complex host architectures, focused on portability, and supported secure networking. However, Java outgrew its own ambitions. It quickly gained momentum as a versatile language for creating enterprise, web, and mobile applications. Today, Java no longer belongs to Sun Microsystems. Oracle Corporation acquired Sun Microsystems in 2010. And with that acquirement, Java became an integral part of Oracle’s <span class="No-Break">software ecosystem.</span></p>
			<p>Java was very unique at the time it was created. The huge success of Java can be attributed to some<a id="_idIndexMarker006"/> of its core features. These features were very innovative at the time but are now found in many other (competing) languages. One of the core features is object-oriented programming. OOP allows us to structure our code in a neat way that helps with reusability and maintainability. We’re going to start discussing the core features by having a look at <strong class="bold">object-oriented </strong><span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">programming</strong></span><span class="No-Break"> (</span><span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">OOP</strong></span><span class="No-Break">).</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-23"><a id="_idTextAnchor022"/>OOP in Java</h2>
			<p>Arguably<a id="_idIndexMarker007"/> the most important feature of Java is its support for OOP. If you ask any Java developer what Java is, the answer is often that it’s an <span class="No-Break">OOP language.</span></p>
			<p>It’s safe to say that OOP is a key feature. <em class="italic">What is this OOP thing?</em> you may wonder. OOP is a programming paradigm. It structures applications to model real-world objects and their interactions and behaviors. Let’s go over the main concepts <span class="No-Break">of OOP:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Objects</strong>: This may be stating the obvious but, in OOP, <strong class="bold">objects</strong> are<a id="_idIndexMarker008"/> the main building blocks of your program. An object is a representation of a real-world entity, such as a user, an email, or<a id="_idIndexMarker009"/> a bank<a id="_idIndexMarker010"/> account. Each object has its own <strong class="bold">attributes</strong> (data fields) and <span class="No-Break">behaviors (</span><span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">methods</strong></span><span class="No-Break">).</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Classes</strong>: Objects are created using their <strong class="bold">class</strong>. A class is a blueprint for creating<a id="_idIndexMarker011"/> objects. It defines the attributes and methods<a id="_idIndexMarker012"/> that objects of the class should have. For example, a <strong class="source-inline">Car</strong> class might define attributes such as color, make, and model, and methods such as start, accelerate, <span class="No-Break">and brake.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Inheritance</strong>: Another key feature is <strong class="bold">inheritance</strong>. Inheritance allows one class<a id="_idIndexMarker013"/> to inherit the<a id="_idIndexMarker014"/> attributes and methods of another class. For example, <strong class="source-inline">Car</strong> could inherit from a <strong class="source-inline">Vehicle</strong> class. We’re not going to cover the details here, but inheritance helps to better structure the code. The code is more reusable, and the hierarchy of related classes opens doors in terms<a id="_idIndexMarker015"/> of what we can<a id="_idIndexMarker016"/> do with <span class="No-Break">our types.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Encapsulation</strong>: Encapsulation is giving a class control over its own data. This is done by bundling<a id="_idIndexMarker017"/> data (attributes) and <a id="_idIndexMarker018"/>methods that operate on that data. The attributes can only be accessed via these special methods from outside. Encapsulation helps to protect the internal state of an object and allows you to control how the object’s data can be accessed or modified. Don’t worry if this sounds tricky still, we’ll deal with this in more <span class="No-Break">detail later.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Polymorphism </strong>and <strong class="bold">Abstraction</strong>: These <a id="_idIndexMarker019"/>are two key<a id="_idIndexMarker020"/> concepts <a id="_idIndexMarker021"/>of OOP that will<a id="_idIndexMarker022"/> be explained later when you’re ready <span class="No-Break">for them.</span></li>
			</ul>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-24"><a id="_idTextAnchor023"/>Working with OOP</h2>
			<p>I can imagine<a id="_idIndexMarker023"/> this all sounds very abstract at this point, but before you know it, you’ll be creating classes and instantiating objects yourself. OOP helps to make code more maintainable, better structured, and reusable. These things really help to be able to make changes to your application, solve problems, and<a id="_idIndexMarker024"/> scale up <span class="No-Break">when needed.</span></p>
			<p>OOP is just one key feature of Java. Another key feature is that it’s a compiled language. Let’s make sure you understand what is meant by <span class="No-Break">that now.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-25"><a id="_idTextAnchor024"/>Compiled language</h2>
			<p>Java is a <strong class="bold">compiled programming language</strong>, which means that the source code you write<a id="_idIndexMarker025"/> must be<a id="_idIndexMarker026"/> transformed into a machine-readable format before it can be interpreted. This machine-readable format is called bytecode. This process is different from that of interpreted languages, where the source code is read, interpreted, and executed on the fly. During runtime, the computer interprets an interpreted language line by line. When a compiled language is running, the computer interprets the bytecode during runtime. We’ll dive deeper into the compilation process in just a bit when we are going to compile our own code. For now, let’s see what the benefits of compiled <span class="No-Break">languages are.</span></p>
			<h3>Benefits of Java being a compiled language</h3>
			<p>Compiling code<a id="_idIndexMarker027"/> first requires an extra step, and it takes time in the beginning, but it brings advantages. First of all, the performance of compiled languages is typically better than interpreted languages. This is because the bytecode gets optimized for efficient execution on the <span class="No-Break">target platform.</span></p>
			<p>Another advantage of compilation is the early detection of syntax errors and certain other types of errors before the code is executed. This enables developers to identify and fix issues before deploying the application, reducing the likelihood of <span class="No-Break">runtime errors.</span></p>
			<p>Java code is turned into bytecode – a form of binary code - by the compiler. This bytecode is platform-independent. This means that it allows Java applications to run on different operating systems without modification. Platform independence is actually the key feature that we’re going to be <span class="No-Break">discussing next.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-26"><a id="_idTextAnchor025"/>Write once, run anywhere</h2>
			<p>Java’s <strong class="bold">Write Once, Run Anywhere</strong> (<strong class="bold">WORA</strong>) principle<a id="_idIndexMarker028"/> is another key feature. This<a id="_idIndexMarker029"/> used to set Java apart from many other programming languages, but now, this is rather common, and many competing languages also implemented this feature. This principle ensures that Java code can run on different platforms without requiring different versions of the Java code for each platform. This means that a Java program is not tied to any specific operating system or <span class="No-Break">hardware architecture.</span></p>
			<p>When you have different versions of the code for each platform, this means that you have to maintain all these versions of the code as well. Let’s say you have a code base for Linux, macOS, and Windows. When a new feature or a change is required, you need to add this to three places! You can imagine that WORA was a game-changer at the time Java came out. And it leads to an increased reach of your application – any device that can run Java applications<a id="_idIndexMarker030"/> can <span class="No-Break">run yours.</span></p>
			<h3>Understanding the WORA elements</h3>
			<p>The WORA principle<a id="_idIndexMarker031"/> is made possible by bytecode and the <strong class="bold">Java Virtual Machine</strong> (<strong class="bold">JVM</strong>). Bytecode is the compiled Java<a id="_idIndexMarker032"/> program. The compiler turns the Java code into this bytecode, and this bytecode<a id="_idIndexMarker033"/> is platform-independent. It can run on any device that can run the <span class="No-Break">bytecode executer.</span></p>
			<p>This bytecode executer is called the JVM. Each platform (Windows, macOS, Linux, and so on) has its own JVM implementation, which is specifically designed to translate bytecode into native machine code for that platform. Since the bytecode remains the same across platforms, the JVM handles the differences between operating systems and hardware architectures. The WORA principle is explained in <span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Figure 1</em></span><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">.1</em></span><span class="No-Break">.</span></p>

				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 1.1 – The WORA principle in a diagram</p>
			<p>You can see <a id="_idIndexMarker034"/>that the compiler creates bytecode and that this bytecode can be picked up by the JVM. The JVM is platform-specific and does the translation to the platform it’s on. There’s more that the JVM does for us, and that is automatic memory management. Let’s explore <span class="No-Break">this next.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-27"><a id="_idTextAnchor026"/>Automatic memory management</h2>
			<p>Another<a id="_idIndexMarker035"/> key feature that made Java great is its <strong class="bold">automatic memory management</strong>, which simplifies development and prevents common memory-related errors. Java handles memory allocation and garbage collection for you. The developer doesn’t need to take care of manually managing <span class="No-Break">the memory.</span></p>
			<p>Nowadays, this is the rule and not the exception. Most other modern languages have automatic memory management as well. However, it is important to know what automatic memory management means. The memory allocation and deallocation are done automatically. This actually leads to simplifying the code. There is no boilerplate code that just focuses on the allocation and deallocation of the memory. This also leads to fewer <span class="No-Break">memory-related</span><span class="No-Break"><a id="_idIndexMarker036"/></span><span class="No-Break"> errors.</span></p>
			<p>Let’s make sure you understand what is meant by memory allocation <span class="No-Break">and deallocation.</span></p>
			<h3>Memory allocation</h3>
			<p>In code, you create variables. Sometimes, these variables are not simple values but complex objects with many data fields. When you create <a id="_idIndexMarker037"/>an object, this object needs to be stored<a id="_idIndexMarker038"/> somewhere in the memory of the device that it’s running on. This is called <strong class="bold">memory allocation</strong>. In Java, when you create an object, device memory is automatically allocated to store the object’s attributes and associated data. This is different from languages such as C and C++, where developers must manually allocate and deallocate memory. Java’s automatic memory allocation streamlines the development process and reduces the chances of memory leaks or dangling pointers, which can cause unexpected behavior or crashes. It also makes the code cleaner to read, since you don’t need to deal with any allocation or <span class="No-Break">deallocation code.</span></p>
			<h3>Garbage collection</h3>
			<p>When a memory block<a id="_idIndexMarker039"/> is no longer used by the application, it needs<a id="_idIndexMarker040"/> to be deallocated. The process Java uses for this is called <strong class="bold">garbage collection</strong>. Garbage collection is the process of identifying and reclaiming memory that is no longer in use by a program. In Java, when an object is no longer accessible or needed, the garbage collector automatically frees up the memory occupied by the object. This process ensures that the memory is efficiently utilized and prevents memory leaks and the problems that come <span class="No-Break">with it.</span></p>
			<p>The JVM periodically runs the garbage collector to identify and clean up unreachable objects. Java’s garbage collection mechanism uses many different sophisticated algorithms to determine when an object is no <span class="No-Break">longer needed.</span></p>
			<p>Now that we’ve covered the basics, let’s move on to <span class="No-Break">installing Java.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-28"><a id="_idTextAnchor027"/>Installing Java</h1>
			<p>Before you can start writing<a id="_idIndexMarker041"/> and running Java programs, you’ll need to set up the JDK on your computer. The JDK contains essential tools and libraries required for Java development, such as the Java compiler, the JRE, and other useful utilities that <span class="No-Break">help development.</span></p>
			<p>We will guide you through the process of installing Java on Windows, macOS, and Linux, and we’ll give you some suggestions for when you don’t have access to either one of those. But before proceeding with the installation of Java, it’s a good idea to check whether it’s already installed on <span class="No-Break">your system.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-29"><a id="_idTextAnchor028"/>Checking whether Java is installed on your system</h2>
			<p>Java may have been pre-installed, or you may have installed it previously without realizing it. To check whether Java is installed, follow these simple steps. The<a id="_idIndexMarker042"/> first one depends on your <span class="No-Break">operating system.</span></p>
			<h3>Step 1 – Open a terminal</h3>
			<p>For Windows, press the <em class="italic">Windows</em> key, type <strong class="source-inline">cmd</strong>, and press <em class="italic">Enter</em> to open the <span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">Command Prompt</strong></span><span class="No-Break">.</span></p>
			<p>For macOS, press <em class="italic">Command</em> + <em class="italic">Space</em> to open the <strong class="bold">Spotlight</strong> search, type <strong class="source-inline">Terminal</strong>, and press <em class="italic">Enter</em> to <span class="No-Break">open </span><span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">Terminal</strong></span><span class="No-Break">.</span></p>
			<p>For Linux, open a Terminal window. The method for opening the Terminal window varies depending on your Linux distribution (for example, in Ubuntu, press <em class="italic">Ctrl</em> + <em class="italic">Alt</em> + <span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">T</em></span><span class="No-Break">).</span></p>
			<h3>Step 2 – Check for the Java version</h3>
			<p>In the Command Prompt or Terminal window, type the following command and <span class="No-Break">press </span><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Enter</em></span><span class="No-Break">:</span></p>
			<pre class="console">
java -version</pre>			<h3>Step 3 – Interpret the response</h3>
			<p>If Java is installed, you will see the version information displayed. If not, the Command Prompt will display an error message, indicating that Java is not recognized <span class="No-Break">or found.</span></p>
			<p>If you find that Java is already installed on your system, make sure it’s version 21 or later to ensure compatibility with modern Java features. If it’s an older version or not installed, proceed with the installation process for your specific platform, as described in the following sections. If an older version is installed, you may want to uninstall this first to avoid having an unnecessarily complicated setup. You can install this the common way of uninstalling<a id="_idIndexMarker043"/> programs for your <span class="No-Break">operating system.</span></p>
			<p>In <span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Figure 1</em></span><em class="italic">.2</em> and <span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Figure 1</em></span><em class="italic">.6</em>, you’ll see examples of the output you can expect when Java <span class="No-Break">is installed.</span></p>

				<li>If you need to set the <strong class="source-inline">JAVA_HOME</strong> environment variable (which you won’t need for working your way through this book but will need for doing more complex Java projects), you first need to determine the installation path by running the <span class="No-Break">following command:</span><pre class="source-code">
sudo update-alternatives --config java</pre></li>				<li>Take note of the path displayed (for <span class="No-Break">example, </span><span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">/usr/lib/jvm/java-19-openjdk-amd64/bin/java</strong></span><span class="No-Break">).</span></li>

			<p>Now, Java should be installed and configured on your Linux <span class="No-Break">operating system.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-33"><a id="_idTextAnchor032"/>Running Java online</h2>
			<p>If you don’t have access<a id="_idIndexMarker060"/> to a computer with macOS, Linux, or Windows, there are online solutions out there. The free options<a id="_idIndexMarker061"/> are not perfect but, for example, the <strong class="bold">w3schools</strong> solution for trying Java in the browser is not bad at all. There are quite a few of these <span class="No-Break">out there.</span></p>
			<p>In order to work with multiple files there might be free tools out there, but most of them are paid. A currently <a id="_idIndexMarker062"/>free one that we would recommend is on <a href="http://replit.com">replit.com</a>. You can find it <span class="No-Break">here: </span><a href="https://replit.com/languages/java"><span class="No-Break">https://replit.com/languages/java</span></a><span class="No-Break">.</span></p>
			<p>You need to sign up, but you can work for free with multiple files and save them on your account. This is a good alternative if you would for example only have a tablet to follow along with <span class="No-Break">this book.</span></p>
			<p>Another option would be to use <a id="_idIndexMarker063"/>GitHub Codespaces: <a href="https://github.com/codespaces">https://github.com/codespaces</a>. They have the opportunity to enter a repository (for example the one we use for this book) and directly try the examples that are available in the repo and adjust them to try <span class="No-Break">new things.</span></p>
			<p>Having navigated through the installation of Java, it’s time to talk about compiling and <span class="No-Break">running programs.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-34"><a id="_idTextAnchor033"/>Writing our first program</h1>
			<p>Before diving<a id="_idIndexMarker064"/> into the process of compiling and running Java programs, let’s create a simple Java program using a basic text editor. This will help you understand the structure of a Java program and how to write and save a Java source code file. For this example, we will create a<strong class="bold"> “Hello world!” program</strong> that will be used to demonstrate the process of compilation <span class="No-Break">and execution.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-35"><a id="_idTextAnchor034"/>Hello world</h2>
			<p>You may have heard of <strong class="bold">“Hello world!” programs</strong>. They are a common<a id="_idIndexMarker065"/> way to start learning a new programming language. It’s a simple program that prints the message <strong class="source-inline">"Hello world!"</strong> to the console. Writing this program will provide you with a very basic understanding of Java syntax, and it will help you to become familiar with the process of writing, compiling, and running <span class="No-Break">Java code.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-36"><a id="_idTextAnchor035"/>Steps to create the program</h2>
			<p>Alright, let’s start <a id="_idIndexMarker066"/>coding. Here are <span class="No-Break">the steps:</span></p>
			<ol>
				<li>First, open<a id="_idIndexMarker067"/> a basic text<a id="_idIndexMarker068"/> editor<a id="_idIndexMarker069"/> on your computer. <strong class="bold">Notepad</strong> on Windows, <strong class="bold">TextEdit</strong> on macOS, or <strong class="bold">Gedit</strong> on Linux are <span class="No-Break">suitable options.</span></li>
				<li>Write the following Java code in your <span class="No-Break">text editor:</span><pre class="source-code">
public class HelloWorld {    public static void main(String[] args) {        System.out.println("Hello world!");    }}</pre></li>				<li>Save the file as <strong class="source-inline">HelloWorld.java</strong> in a directory of your choice. Don’t forget the <strong class="source-inline">.java</strong> extension when saving the file. This indicates that the file contains Java source code. The code should not have <strong class="source-inline">.txt</strong> after <strong class="source-inline">.java</strong>. This happens sometimes in Windows, so make <a id="_idIndexMarker070"/>sure to not select the text file in the <span class="No-Break">filetype dropdown.</span></li>
			</ol>
			<p class="callout-heading">TextEdit – file extension issues</p>
			<p class="callout">The later versions<a id="_idIndexMarker071"/> of macOS have some issues with <strong class="bold">TextEdit</strong>. You can’t save it as a Java file by default. In order to enable this, you need to go to <strong class="bold">Format</strong> | <strong class="bold">Make Plain Text</strong> and <span class="No-Break">select </span><span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">UTF-8</strong></span><span class="No-Break">.</span></p>
			<p class="callout">After this, you can save it as a <strong class="source-inline">.java</strong> file. You may still run into encoding errors; the problem is with the encoding, and fixing<a id="_idIndexMarker072"/> it might be<a id="_idIndexMarker073"/> a lot of effort<a id="_idIndexMarker074"/> missing the goal of this exercise. It might be better to download <strong class="bold">Notepad++</strong>, <strong class="bold">TextPad</strong>, or <strong class="bold">Sublime</strong> for this part. Or go ahead and download the <strong class="source-inline">HelloWorld.java</strong> file from our <span class="No-Break">GitHub repository.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-37"><a id="_idTextAnchor036"/>Understanding the program</h2>
			<p>Let’s have a look<a id="_idIndexMarker075"/> at the code we just used. First of all, be aware that this is <em class="italic">case-sensitive</em>. That means that when you look at the code, most things will not work as you expect if you mix up lowercase <span class="No-Break">and uppercase.</span></p>
			<p>First, we created a class named <strong class="source-inline">HelloWorld</strong> with a <strong class="source-inline">main</strong> method. We’ll cover classes and methods in a lot more detail, of course. But a class is the fundamental building block of Java applications, and it can contain methods. Methods can be executed to do things – <em class="italic">things</em> being <span class="No-Break">executing statements.</span></p>
			<p>The <strong class="source-inline">main</strong> method is a special method. It is the entry point of our Java program and contains the code that will be executed when the program is run. The line with <strong class="source-inline">System.out.println("Hello world!");</strong> writes the <strong class="source-inline">Hello world!</strong> message to the console. Please note, that <strong class="source-inline">println</strong> stands for print line, so it uses a lowercase <em class="italic">L</em> and not an <span class="No-Break">uppercase </span><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">i</em></span><span class="No-Break">.</span></p>
			<p>With the <strong class="source-inline">HelloWorld.java</strong> file saved, we are now ready to move on to the next section, where we will learn how to compile and run the Java program using the command line and <span class="No-Break">an IDE.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-38"><a id="_idTextAnchor037"/>Compiling and running Java programs</h1>
			<p>Now that we have our first program written, let’s discuss how we can compile and run it. We will cover the basics of the compilation process, the role of the JVM, and how to compile and run Java code using the command line and <span class="No-Break">an IDE.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-39"><a id="_idTextAnchor038"/>Understanding the compilation process</h2>
			<p>The source code<a id="_idIndexMarker076"/> is written in a human-readable format using the Java programming language. Or at least, we hope that this is your opinion after this book. Before the code can be executed, it must be transformed into a format that the computer can understand. You already know that Java is a compiled language<a id="_idIndexMarker077"/> and that this process is <span class="No-Break">called compilation.</span></p>
			<p>During compilation, the <strong class="bold">Java compiler</strong> (<strong class="bold">javac</strong>) converts the source code (<strong class="source-inline">.java</strong> files) into bytecode (<strong class="source-inline">.class</strong> files). Once<a id="_idIndexMarker078"/> the bytecode is generated, it can be executed by the JVM. We have already learned that the JVM is the bytecode executer and that every platform has its own custom JVM enabling the WORA feature <span class="No-Break">of Java.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-40"><a id="_idTextAnchor039"/>Compiling the code with javac on the command line</h2>
			<p>To compile a Java program<a id="_idIndexMarker079"/> using the command line, follow <span class="No-Break">these steps:</span></p>
			<ol>
				<li>Open a terminal (Command Prompt on Windows, Terminal on macOS <span class="No-Break">or Linux).</span></li>
				<li>Navigate to the directory containing your Java source code file (for example, the directory of your previously created <strong class="source-inline">HelloWorld.java</strong> file). In case you don’t know how to do that, this can be done with the <strong class="source-inline">cd</strong> command, which stands for <em class="italic">change directory</em>. For example, if I’m in a directory called <strong class="source-inline">documents</strong> and I want to step into the subfolder called <strong class="source-inline">java programs</strong>, I’d run the <strong class="source-inline">cd "java programs"</strong> command. The quotes are only needed when there are spaces in the directory name. It’s beyond the scope of this book to explain how to change directories for any platform. There are many excellent explanations for every platform on how to navigate the folder structure using the command line on <span class="No-Break">the internet.</span></li>
				<li>Once you’re in the folder containing the Java file, enter the following command to compile the Java <span class="No-Break">source code:</span><pre class="source-code">
javac HelloWorld.java</pre><p class="list-inset">If the compilation is successful, a new file with the same name but a <strong class="source-inline">.class</strong> extension (for example, <strong class="source-inline">HelloWorld.class</strong>) will be created in the same directory. This file contains the bytecode that can be executed by <span class="No-Break">the JVM.</span></p></li>			</ol>
			<p>Let’s see how we can run this <span class="No-Break">compiled code.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-41"><a id="_idTextAnchor040"/>Running the compiled code with Java on the command line</h2>
			<p>To run the compiled<a id="_idIndexMarker080"/> Java program, follow <span class="No-Break">these steps:</span></p>
			<ol>
				<li>In the terminal, make sure you are still in the directory containing the <strong class="source-inline">.</strong><span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">class</strong></span><span class="No-Break"> file.</span></li>
				<li>Enter the following command to execute <span class="No-Break">the bytecode:</span><pre class="source-code">
java HelloWorld</pre></li>			</ol>
			<p>The JVM will load and run the bytecode, and you should see the output of your program. In this case, the output will be <span class="No-Break">as follows:</span></p>
			<pre class="console">
Hello world!</pre>			<p>It’s pretty cool that we can write<a id="_idIndexMarker081"/> Java in Notepad and run it on the command line, but the life of a modern-day Java developer is a lot nicer. Let’s add IDEs to the mix and see this <span class="No-Break">for ourselves.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-42"><a id="_idTextAnchor041"/>Working with an IDE</h1>
			<p>Creating files in text editors<a id="_idIndexMarker082"/> is a little old-fashioned. Of course, you can still do it this way – it’s actually an excellent way of becoming an amazing programmer, but it’s also a very frustrating way. There are tools available to do quite a bit of the heavy work for us and to assist us while writing our code. These tools are <span class="No-Break">called IDEs.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-43"><a id="_idTextAnchor042"/>What is an IDE?</h2>
			<p>An IDE is a software <a id="_idIndexMarker083"/>application that comes with everything you need to write, compile, run, and test your code. Using an IDE can make it easier to develop all sorts of programs. Not only that but also debugging and managing your code is easier. Comparatively, you can think of an IDE somewhat like Microsoft Office Word for me as I write this book. While I could have written it using Notepad, using Word provides significant advantages. It assists in checking for spelling errors and allows me to easily add and visualize layouts, among other helpful features. This analogy paints a picture of how an IDE doesn’t just provide a platform to write code but also offers a suite of tools to streamline and enhance your <span class="No-Break">coding experience.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-44"><a id="_idTextAnchor043"/>Choosing an IDE</h2>
			<p>When it comes<a id="_idIndexMarker084"/> to Java development, there are several IDEs available, each with its own set of features and capabilities. In this section, we will discuss the factors to consider when choosing an IDE and help you set up some <a id="_idIndexMarker085"/>popular Java IDEs. Throughout this book, we’ll be working with <strong class="bold">IntelliJ</strong>. Alternatives<a id="_idIndexMarker086"/> that are also great would<a id="_idIndexMarker087"/> be <strong class="bold">VS Code</strong> <span class="No-Break">and </span><span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">Eclipse</strong></span><span class="No-Break">.</span></p>
			<h3>Factors to consider when choosing an IDE</h3>
			<p>Most modern IDEs<a id="_idIndexMarker088"/> have features such as code completion, debugging, version control integration, and support for third-party tools and frameworks. Some of them have better versions of these than others. Compare and contrast what you prefer when choosing or <span class="No-Break">switching IDEs.</span></p>
			<p>Some IDEs require a heavier system to run on than others. For example, VS Code is rather lightweight and IntelliJ is rather heavy. Also, VS Code can be used for many languages, including Java. It is uncommon to do a lot of other things with IntelliJ rather than Java. Choose an IDE that provides a balance between features and performance, especially if you have limited <span class="No-Break">system resources.</span></p>
			<p>And of course, it’s possible that the IDE you’d prefer is not available for the platform you’re using. Make sure that it’s available and stable for <span class="No-Break">your system.</span></p>
			<p>Lastly, and very importantly, think about the costs. Some IDEs are free and others require a paid license. Luckily, many of the ones that require a paid license have a free edition for non-commercial use. So, make sure to also consider your budget and the licensing you need when choosing <span class="No-Break">an IDE.</span></p>
			<p>In the following subsections, we’ll walk you through the steps of setting up the three (currently) most common IDEs for <span class="No-Break">Java development:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><span class="No-Break">IntelliJ</span></li>
				<li><span class="No-Break">Eclipse</span></li>
				<li>Visual <span class="No-Break">Studio Code</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p class="callout-heading"> Note</p>
			<p class="callout"> We’ll be working with IntelliJ for the rest of <span class="No-Break">this book.</span></p>
			<h3>Setting up IntelliJ</h3>
			<p>So, let’s start with that one. IntelliJ IDEA<a id="_idIndexMarker089"/> is a popular Java IDE<a id="_idIndexMarker090"/> that was developed by <strong class="bold">JetBrains</strong>. It offers both a free <strong class="bold">Community Edition</strong> and a paid <strong class="bold">Ultimate Edition</strong>. It provides a wide range of features, including intelligent code completion, debugging tools, version control integration, and support for various <span class="No-Break">Java frameworks.</span></p>
			<p>Here are the steps for <span class="No-Break">installing IntelliJ:</span></p>
			<ol>
				<li>Visit the<a id="_idIndexMarker091"/> IntelliJ IDEA download page <span class="No-Break">at </span><a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/"><span class="No-Break">https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/</span></a><span class="No-Break">.</span></li>
				<li>Choose the edition you prefer: the free <strong class="bold">Community Edition</strong> or the paid <strong class="bold">Ultimate Edition</strong>. For beginners, the Community Edition is truly <span class="No-Break">great already.</span></li>
				<li>Download the installer for your operating system (Windows, macOS, <span class="No-Break">or Linux).</span></li>
				<li>Run the installer and follow the instructions to complete <span class="No-Break">the installation.</span></li>
				<li>Launch <strong class="bold">IntelliJ IDEA</strong>. If you’re using the Ultimate Edition, you may need to enter your JetBrains account credentials or a <span class="No-Break">license key.</span></li>
				<li>On the <strong class="bold">Welcome</strong> screen, you can create a new <strong class="bold">project</strong>, import an existing <strong class="bold">project</strong>, or explore the available tutorials <span class="No-Break">and</span><span class="No-Break"><a id="_idIndexMarker092"/></span><span class="No-Break"> documentation.</span></li>
			</ol>
			<h3>Setting up Eclipse</h3>
			<p>Eclipse is a free, open source Java IDE that is widely used<a id="_idIndexMarker093"/> in the Java community. It has been around for a really long time already and quite a lot of companies work with it still. It offers a variety of features, just like IntelliJ. Eclipse can be customized to suit your needs, but its interface may be less intuitive than <span class="No-Break">other IDEs.</span></p>
			<p>To set up Eclipse, follow <span class="No-Break">these steps:</span></p>
			<ol>
				<li>Visit the Eclipse<a id="_idIndexMarker094"/> download page <span class="No-Break">at </span><a href="https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/"><span class="No-Break">https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/</span></a><span class="No-Break">.</span></li>
				<li>Download the Eclipse installer for your operating system (Windows, macOS, <span class="No-Break">or Linux).</span></li>
				<li>Run the installer and select <strong class="bold">Eclipse IDE for Java Developers</strong> from the list of <span class="No-Break">available packages.</span></li>
				<li>Choose an installation folder and follow the instructions to complete <span class="No-Break">the installation.</span></li>
				<li>Launch <strong class="bold">Eclipse</strong> and select a workspace directory. This is where your projects and settings will <span class="No-Break">be stored.</span></li>
				<li>On the <strong class="bold">Welcome</strong> screen, you can create a new Java <strong class="bold">project</strong>, import an existing <strong class="bold">project</strong>, or explore the available tutorials<a id="_idIndexMarker095"/> <span class="No-Break">and documentation.</span></li>
			</ol>
			<h3>Setting up Visual Studio Code</h3>
			<p>Visual Studio Code, often referred to as VS Code, is a lightweight, free, and open source code editor<a id="_idIndexMarker096"/> developed by Microsoft. It’s incredibly popular for all sorts of tasks because it supports a wide range of programming languages. It is a popular choice for developers who prefer a more minimalist and fast-performing environment. All sorts of additions can be added with the use <span class="No-Break">of extensions.</span></p>
			<p>Here are the steps for installing VS Code and preparing it for <span class="No-Break">Java development:</span></p>
			<ol>
				<li>Visit the Visual Studio Code<a id="_idIndexMarker097"/> download page <span class="No-Break">at </span><span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">https://code.visualstudio.com/download</strong></span><span class="No-Break">.</span></li>
				<li>Download the installer for your operating system (Windows, macOS, <span class="No-Break">or Linux).</span></li>
				<li>Run the installer and follow the on-screen instructions to complete <span class="No-Break">the installation.</span></li>
				<li>Launch Visual <span class="No-Break">Studio Code.</span></li>
				<li>Open the <strong class="bold">Extensions</strong> view by clicking on the <em class="italic">Extensions</em> icon (four squares) on the left side of <span class="No-Break">the window.</span></li>
				<li>Search for <strong class="bold">Java Extension Pack</strong> in the <em class="italic">Extensions Marketplace</em> and click the <strong class="bold">Install</strong> button. This extension pack includes various extensions for Java development, such as <strong class="bold">Language Support for Java (TM) by Red Hat</strong>, <strong class="bold">Debugger for Java</strong>, and <strong class="bold">Maven </strong><span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">for Java</strong></span><span class="No-Break">.</span></li>
				<li>With the <strong class="bold">Java Extension Pack</strong> installed, you can now create or import Java projects. If it doesn’t load <a id="_idIndexMarker098"/>directly, you may need to reopen <span class="No-Break">VS Code.</span></li>
			</ol>
			<p>Now that you’ve set up an IDE, let’s create and run a program <span class="No-Break">with it.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-45"><a id="_idTextAnchor044"/>Creating and running a program with an IDE</h1>
			<p>Working with an IDE such as IntelliJ as compared to working with a plain text editor is a breeze. We’re now going to guide you through creating, running, and debugging a program with the use of IntelliJ. We’ll create the same program as we did when we were using the <span class="No-Break">text editor.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-46"><a id="_idTextAnchor045"/>Creating a program in an IDE</h2>
			<p>When you use an IDE<a id="_idIndexMarker099"/> to type code, you’ll see<a id="_idIndexMarker100"/> that it helps you to complete your code constantly. This is considered very helpful by most people, and we hope you’ll enjoy this <span class="No-Break">feature too.</span></p>
			<p>In order to get started with IntelliJ, we first need to create a project. Here are the steps for creating our <strong class="source-inline">Hello World</strong> <span class="No-Break">program again:</span></p>
			<ol>
				<li>Launch IntelliJ IDEA and<a id="_idIndexMarker101"/> click on <strong class="bold">New Project</strong> from the <strong class="bold">Welcome</strong> screen or go to <strong class="bold">File</strong> | <strong class="bold">New</strong> | <span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">Project</strong></span><span class="No-Break">.</span></li>

			<p>Admittedly, we had<a id="_idIndexMarker109"/> to take a few extra <a id="_idIndexMarker110"/>steps to create our program. We had to create a project first. The good news is, running the program is easier! Here’s how to <span class="No-Break">do it:</span></p>
			<ol>
				<li>If you haven’t done so, make sure your changes are saved by pressing <em class="italic">Ctrl</em> + <em class="italic">S</em> (Windows/Linux) or <em class="italic">Cmd</em> + <em class="italic">S</em> (macOS). By default, auto-save <span class="No-Break">is enabled.</span></li>
				<li>To run <a id="_idIndexMarker111"/>the program, right-click<a id="_idIndexMarker112"/> anywhere in the <strong class="source-inline">HelloWorld</strong> class and select <strong class="source-inline">Run 'HelloWorld.main()'</strong>. Alternatively, you can click the green triangle icon next to the main method and select <strong class="source-inline">Run 'HelloWorld.main()'</strong>. IntelliJ will compile and run <span class="No-Break">the program.</span></li>

			<p class="callout-heading">Saved and unsaved files</p>
			<p class="callout">In most IDEs, you can tell whether a file is saved or not by looking at the tab of the open file. It has a dot or an asterisk next to it if it isn’t saved. The dot is missing if it has <span class="No-Break">been saved.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-48"><a id="_idTextAnchor047"/>Debugging a program</h2>
			<p>Our program is quite easy right<a id="_idIndexMarker113"/> now, but we<a id="_idIndexMarker114"/> may want to step through our program line by line. We can do that by debugging the program. Let’s give our file a little extra content for debugging. This way we can see how to inspect variables, understand the execution flow, and, this way, find the flaws in <span class="No-Break">our code:</span></p>
			<ol>
				<li>Update the <strong class="source-inline">HelloWorld.java</strong> file with the <span class="No-Break">following code:</span><pre class="source-code">
public class HelloWorld {    public static void main(String[] args) {        String greeting = "Hello, World!";        System.out.println(greeting);        int number = 5;        int doubled = doubleNumber(number);        System.out.println("The doubled number is: " +          doubled);    }    public static int doubleNumber(int input) {        return input * 2;    }}</pre></li>				<li>In this updated version of the program, we added a new method called <strong class="source-inline">doubleNumber</strong>, which takes an integer as input and returns its double. In the <strong class="source-inline">main</strong> method, we call this method and print the result. Don’t worry if you don’t fully get this – we just want to show you how you can step through <span class="No-Break">your code.</span></li>
				<li>Save your changes by pressing <em class="italic">Ctrl</em> + <em class="italic">S</em> (Windows/Linux) or <em class="italic">Cmd</em> + <span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">S</em></span><span class="No-Break"> (macOS).</span><p class="list-inset">Now, let’s debug the <span class="No-Break">updated program.</span></p></li>
				<li>Set a breakpoint<a id="_idIndexMarker115"/> on the line<a id="_idIndexMarker116"/> you want to pause the execution at by clicking in the gutter area next to the line number in the editor. A red dot will appear, indicating a breakpoint. For example, set a breakpoint at the line <strong class="source-inline">int doubled = doubleNumber(number);</strong>. An example is shown in <span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Figure 1</em></span><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">.7</em></span><span class="No-Break">.</span></li>

				<li>When the line with the breakpoint is going to be executed, the program will pause. During the pause, you can use the <strong class="bold">Debug</strong> tool window, which will appear at the bottom of the screen. Here, you can view the state of the program, including the values of local variables and fields.

			<p>By following these steps, you can debug Java programs using IntelliJ IDEA and step through the code to see what is happening. This is something that will come in handy to understand what is going on in your code. This process will be similar in other Java IDEs, although the specific steps and interface elements <span class="No-Break">may vary.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-49"><a id="_idTextAnchor048"/>Exercises</h1>
			<p>And that’s all theory for this chapter! So, roll up those sleeves, and let’s dive into your first day at Mesozoic Eden. Welcome aboard! Mesozoic Eden is a famous zoo where dinosaurs live that have been brought to live with high end genetic manipulation techniques. Here are some exercises for you to test your knowledge <span class="No-Break">so far:</span></p>
			<ol>
				<li>Your first task involves welcoming our guests. Modify the following code snippet so that it outputs <strong class="source-inline">"Welcome to </strong><span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">Mesozoic Eden"</strong></span><span class="No-Break">:</span><pre class="source-code">
public class Main {    public static void main(String[] args) {        System.out.println("Hello world");    }}</pre></li>				<li>Complete the following programs by filling out the blanks so that it prints out your name and the position you want to have in Mesozoic Eden 5 years <span class="No-Break">from now:</span><pre class="source-code">
public class Main {    public static void main(String[] args) {        __________________________;        String position = "Park Manager";        System.out.println("My name is " + name + "          and I want to be a " ______ " in Mesozoic            Eden.");    }}</pre></li>				<li>We’ve received some questions about opening hours. Complete the following program so that it prints the park’s opening and <span class="No-Break">closing hours:</span><pre class="source-code">
public class Main {    public static void main(String[] args) {        String openingHours = "08:00";        String closingHours = "20:00";    }}</pre></li>				<li>Create a Java project with a package named <strong class="source-inline">dinosaur</strong>. You can create a package by right-clicking on the <strong class="source-inline">src/main/java</strong> folder, selecting “new” and <span class="No-Break">choosing “package”.</span></li>
				<li>Modify the code from exercise 1 so that it prints out <strong class="source-inline">"Welcome, [YourName] to Mesozoic Eden!"</strong>, where <strong class="source-inline">[YourName]</strong> is replaced by, surprise surprise, your name. Bonus: try to create a separate String variable as shown in the second and <span class="No-Break">third exercises.</span></li>
				<li>Some guests reported feeling unsafe near the T-Rex. Let’s solve this by adding another <strong class="source-inline">System.out.println</strong> to the program of exercise 5. It should print the phrase <strong class="source-inline">"Mesozoic Eden is safe and secure."</strong> after the <span class="No-Break">welcome message.</span></li>
			</ol>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-50"><a id="_idTextAnchor049"/>Project</h1>
			<p>Create a program that simulates a sign at the entrance of Mesozoic Eden. The sign is simulated by printing output to the console. The sign should display a welcome message, the opening and closing hours, and a short <span class="No-Break">safety message.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-51"><a id="_idTextAnchor050"/>Summary</h1>
			<p>You’ve made it through the first chapter! And we’ve done a lot already. We kicked off by exploring Java’s key features, such as its OOP approach, the (once unique) WORA principle, its compiled nature, and the super-helpful automatic memory management. These features make Java an incredibly versatile and powerful language – a great choice for different programming tasks, such as web development, desktop apps, mobile apps, and so <span class="No-Break">much more!</span></p>
			<p>Next, we walked you through the process of installing Java on various platforms: Windows, macOS, and Linux. We also discussed how to check whether Java is already installed on your system. After this part, you can be sure that you have all the essential tools to kick off your Java <span class="No-Break">programming adventure.</span></p>
			<p>After you had Java all setup, we demystified the compilation process and introduced you to the JVM, a vital component of the Java ecosystem that enables the portability of Java code. We then demonstrated how to compile and run Java code using the <strong class="source-inline">javac</strong> and <strong class="source-inline">java</strong> command-line tools. These tools lay the groundwork for working with Java programs at <span class="No-Break">their core.</span></p>
			<p>Of course, using the command line for this is great. But nowadays, we more often work with an IDE, and we can just press a button to do all this. So, we mentioned several advantages and nice features of working with an IDE, such as code completion, debugging, and project management. We discussed the factors to weigh up when choosing an IDE and provided guidance on setting up popular IDEs such as IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, and VS Code. In this book, we’ll be using IntelliJ throughout for <span class="No-Break">the examples.</span></p>
			<p>After covering the essentials of IDEs, we delved into creating and running a Java program using an IDE. We explained the structure of a typical Java program and guided you, step by step, through the process of creating, running, and debugging your very first <span class="No-Break">Java program.</span></p>
			<p>After this, you were ready for the first hands-on project. And now you’re here! All set and ready to take the next step on your Java journey. This next step will be working with variables and primitive data types. <span class="No-Break">Good luck!</span></p>
