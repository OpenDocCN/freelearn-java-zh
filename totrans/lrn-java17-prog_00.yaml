- en: The purpose of this book is to equip the readers with a solid understanding
    of Java fundamentals and to lead them through a series of practical steps from
    the basics to the actual real programming. The discussion and examples aim to
    stimulate the growth of the reader’s professional intuition by using proven programming
    principles and practices. The book starts with the basics and brings the readers
    up to the latest programming technologies, considered on a professional level.

  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[*Chapter 1*](B18388_01_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor015), *Getting Started with
    Java 17*, begins with the basics, first explaining what “Java” is and defining
    its main terms, then going on to how to install the necessary tools to write and
    run (execute) a program. This chapter also describes the basic Java language constructs,
    illustrating them with examples that can be executed immediately.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[*Chapter 2*](B18388_02_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor045), Java *Object-Oriented
    Programming (OOP),* presents the concepts of object-oriented programming and how
    they are implemented in Java. Each concept is demonstrated with specific code
    examples. The Java language constructs of class and interface are discussed in
    detail, as well as overloading, overriding, hiding, and use of the final keyword.
    The last section of the chapter is dedicated to presenting the power of polymorphism.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[*Chapter 3*](B18388_03_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor079), *Java Fundamentals*,
    presents to the reader a more detailed view of Java as a language. It starts with
    the code organization in packages and a description of the accessibility levels
    of classes (interfaces) and their methods and properties (fields). The reference
    types as the main types of Java’s object-oriented nature are presented in much
    detail, followed by a list of reserved and restricted keywords and a discussion
    of their usage. The chapter ends with the methods of conversion between primitive
    types, and from a primitive type to the corresponding reference type and back.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[*Chapter 4*](B18388_04_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor110), *Exception Handling*,
    tells the reader about the syntax of the Java constructs related to exception
    handling and the best practices to address (handle) exceptions. The chapter ends
    with the related topic of the assertion statement that can be used to debug the
    application code in production.'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[*Chapter 5*](B18388_05_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor121), *Strings, Input/Output,
    and Files*, discusses the String class methods, as well as popular string utilities
    from standard libraries and the Apache Commons project. An overview of Java input/output
    streams and related classes of the java.io package follow along with some classes
    of the org.apache.commons.io package. The file-managing classes and their methods
    are described in a dedicated section.'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[*Chapter 6*](B18388_06_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor141), *Data Structures, Generics,
    and Popular Utilities*, presents the Java collections framework and its three
    main interfaces, List, Set, and Map, including discussion and demonstration of
    generics. The `equals()` and `hashCode()` methods are also discussed in the context
    of Java collections. Utility classes for managing arrays, objects, and time/date
    values have corresponding dedicated sections, too.'

    Libraries*, provides an overview of the functionality of the most popular packages
    of Java Class Library (JCL): java.lang, java.util, java.time, java.io and java.nio,
    java.sql and javax.sql, java.net, java.lang.math, java.math, java.awt, javax.swing,
    and javafx. The most popular external libraries are represented by the org.junit,
    org.mockito, org.apache.log4j, org.slf4j, and org.apache.commons packages. This
    chapter helps the reader to avoid writing custom code in cases where such functionality
    already exists and can be just imported and used out of the box.'

- en: '[*Chapter 8*](B18388_08_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor187), *Multithreading and Concurrent
    Processing*, presents the ways to increase Java application performance by using
    workers (threads) that process data concurrently. It explains the concept of Java
    threads and demonstrates their usage. It also talks about the difference between
    parallel and concurrent processing, and how to avoid unpredictable results caused
    by the concurrent modification of a shared resource.'

    Collection*, provides the readers with an overview of JVM’s structure and behavior,
    which are more complex than we usually expect. One of the service threads, called
    garbage collection, performs an important mission of releasing the memory from
    unused objects. After reading this chapter, the readers will understand better
    what constitutes Java application execution, Java processes inside JVM, garbage
    collection, and how JVM works in general.'

    and delete–data in a database from a Java application. It also provides a short
    introduction to the SQL language and basic database operations: how to connect
    to a database, how to create a database structure, how to write a database expression
    using SQL, and how to execute them.'

    reviewed in [*Chapter 5*](B18388_05_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor121), *Strings, Input/Output,
    and Files*. It defines what data streams are, how to process their elements using
    methods (operations) of the java.util.stream.Stream object, and how to chain (connect)
    stream operations in a pipeline. It also discusses the stream’s initialization
    and how to process the stream in parallel.'

    “responsive”, and so on. Using them, it then defines and discusses reactive programming,
    the main reactive frameworks, and talks about RxJava in more details.'
