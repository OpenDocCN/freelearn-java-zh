			<h1 id="_idParaDest-5"><a id="_idTextAnchor004"/>Preface</h1>
			<p>Spring Boot provides JavaScript users with a platform to get an application up and running with just a few lines of code. At the same time, Angular is a component-based framework that makes building a web application’s frontend easy. This book explains how Spring Boot and Angular work together to help you create full-stack applications quickly <span class="No-Break">and effectively.</span></p>
			<p>In this book, you will begin by exploring why Spring Boot and Angular are in-demand frameworks, before being guided by expert solutions and best practices to build your own web application. Regarding the backend, you will see how Spring Boot allows you to build applications efficiently by letting the Spring Framework and Spring Boot extension do the heavy lifting, while using Spring Data JPA and Postgres dependencies in your project to save or persist data in a database. With the frontend, you will use Angular to construct a project architecture, build Reactive forms, and add authentication to avoid malicious users stealing data from <span class="No-Break">the application.</span></p>
			<p>Finally, you will see how to test services with Mockito, deploy applications using continuous integration and continuous deployment, and integrate Spring Boot and Angular to create a single package so that, by the end of the book, you will be able to build your very own full-stack <span class="No-Break">web application.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-6"><a id="_idTextAnchor005"/>Who this book is for</h1>
			<p>The book is for busy Java web developers and TypeScript developers with little experience of developing Angular and Spring Boot apps who want to learn about the best practices for building full-stack web apps. </p>
