- en: This cookbook offers a range of software development examples in simple and
    straightforward Java 9 code, providing step-by-step resources and time-saving
    methods to help you solve data problems efficiently. Starting with the installation
    of Java, each recipe addresses a specific problem, with a discussion that explains
    the solution, and offers insight into how it works. We cover major concepts about
    the core programming language as well as common tasks to build a wide variety
    of software. You will learn new features in the form of recipes, to make your
    application modular, secure, and fast.
