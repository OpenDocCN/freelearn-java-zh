- en: jBPM is a leading open source BPM and workflow platform whose development is
    sponsored by Red Hat under Apache Software License (ASL) licensing. The jBPM product
    has been around for almost 10 years; its strongest points rely on flexibility,
    extensibility, and lightness, and it is a modular, cross-platform pure Java engine
    that is BPMN2 compliant.

    the user during the business process life cycle: development, deployment, and
    versioning. It integrates with widely-adopted frameworks and technologies (SOAP,
    REST, Spring, Java EE CDI, and OSGi) and provides off-the-shelf support to Git
    and Maven.'

    web application or as a service; it can be tightly embedded into a classical desktop
    application or loosely integrated into a complex event-driven architecture. In
    its default configuration, jBPM can be hosted by the enterprise class application
    server Red Hat EAP 6.x or the bleeding-edge Red Hat WildFly 8 server.
