- en: The Java Platform, Enterprise Edition (Java EE) is a collection of API specifications
    designed to work together when developing server-side, enterprise Java applications.
    Java EE is a standard; there are multiple implementations of the Java EE specifications.
    This fact prevents vendor lock-in since code developed against the Java EE specification
    can be deployed to any Java EE-compliant application server with minimal or no
    modifications.

    responsible for the development of Java technology. JCP members include Oracle

- en: The **Java Community Process** (**JCP**) allows interested parties to assist
    in developing standard technical specification for Java technology. Both companies
    and individuals can become members of the JCP and contribute to any technical
    specification they may be interested in. Each Java EE API specification is developed
    as part of a **Java Specification Request** (**JSR**). Each JSR is assigned a
    unique number. **JavaServer Faces** (**JSF**) 2.3 is developed as JSR 372, for
    instance.

- en: Since Java EE is developed under the JCP, no one company has complete control
    over the Java EE specification, since, as mentioned before, the JCP is available
    to the Java community at large, both software vendors and interested individuals.

    Java EE specifications; the end result is that Java EE is jointly developed by
    various members of the Java community.

- en: The preceding list is a list of specifications, application server vendors or
    the open source community need to provide implementations for each Java EE API
    specification. Application server vendors then bundle a set of Java EE API implementations
    together as part of their application server offerings. Since each implementation
    is compliant with the corresponding Java EE JSR, code developed against one implementation
    can run unmodified against any other implementation, avoiding vendor lock-in.

    are split up into small modules deployed independently, interacting with each
    other via the network, typically by leveraging RESTful web services.

- en: At its core, Java EE is a specificationâ€”a piece of paper, if you will. Implementations
    of Java EE specifications need to be developed so that application developers
    can actually develop server-side, enterprise Java applications against the Java
    EE standard. Each Java EE API has multiple implementations; the popular Hibernate
    Object-Relational Mapping tool, for example, is an implementation of Java EE's
    Java Persistence API (JPA). However, it is by no means the only JPA implementation;
    other JPA implementations include EclipseLink and OpenJPA. Similarly, there are
    multiple implementations of every single Java EE API specification.

- en: Java EE applications are typically deployed to an application server; some popular
    application servers include JBoss, Websphere, Weblogic, and GlassFish. Each application
    server is considered to be a Java EE implementation. Application server vendors
    either develop their own implementation of the several Java EE API specifications
    or choose to include an existing implementation.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Application developers benefit from the Java EE standard by not being tied to
    a specific Java EE implementation. As long as an application is developed against
    standard Java EE APIs, it should be very portable across application server vendors.

- en: Java EE was introduced back in 2006; the first version of Java EE was Java EE
    5\. Java EE replaced J2EE; the last version of J2EE was J2EE 1.4, released back
    in 2003\. Even though J2EE can be considered a dead technology, replaced by Java
    EE over 11 years ago, the term J2EE refuses to die. Many individuals to this day
    still refer to Java EE as J2EE; many companies advertise on their websites and
    job boards that they are looking for "J2EE developers", seemingly unaware that
    they are referring to a technology that has been dead for several years. The correct
    term is and has been for a long time, Java EE.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Additionally, the term J2EE has become a "catch-all" term for any server-side
    Java technology; frequently Spring applications are referred to as J2EE applications.
    Spring is not, and has never been, J2EE; as a matter of fact, Spring was created
    by Rod Johnson as an alternative to J2EE back in 2002\. Just like with Java EE,
    Spring applications are frequently erroneously referred to as J2EE applications.
