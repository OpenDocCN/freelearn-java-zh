There are all sorts of new languages with different paradigms and different ways of working. Clojure is one of those languages, one that we believe is worth learning.</p><p>The Java Virtual Machine plays a huge role in the performance of the Clojure programs. Clojure brings functional programming to the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), and also to web browsers through ClojureScript.</p><p>With the recent rise of parallel data processing and multicore architectures, functional programming languages have become more popular for creating software that is both provable and performant. Like other functional programming languages, Clojure focuses on the use of functions and immutable data structures for writing programs. Clojure also adds a hint of Lisp through the use of symbolic expressions and a dynamic type system.</p><div class="section" title="What this learning path covers"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl1sec01"/>What this learning path covers</h1></div></div></div><p>
<a class="link" href="pt01.html" title="Part 1. Module 1">Module 1</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Clojure for Java Developers</em></span>, introduces you to Clojure and how opinionated it is. You will learn why immutable objects are not only possible, but it is a good idea to use them. You will also learn about functional programming and see how it fits the concept of immutable programs. You will understand the very powerful idea of representing your code as a data structure of the same language. Further, we will find similarities and differences from the Java language that you already know, so you can understand how the Clojure world works.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="pt02.html" title="Part 2. Module 2">Module 2</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>, Clojure High Performance Programming, Second Edition</em></span>, increases the focus on the JVM tools for performance management, and it explores how to use those. This module will equip the you with performance measurement and profiling tools and with the know-how of analyzing and tuning the performance characteristics of Clojure code.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="pt03.html" title="Part 3. Module 3">Module 3</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>, Mastering Clojure</em></span>, walks you through the interesting features of the Clojure language. We will also discuss some of the more advanced and lesser known programming constructs in Clojure. Several libraries from the Clojure ecosystem that we can put to practical use in our own programs will also be described. You won’t need to be convinced any more about the elegance and power of the Clojure language by the time you’ve finished this module.</p></div></div>
<div class="section" title="What you need for this learning path"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl1sec02"/>What you need for this learning path</h1></div></div></div><p>You need the Java SDK. You should be able to run samples on any OS; our samples should be easier to follow in environments where there is a shell available. (We focus mainly on Mac OS X.)</p><p>You should acquire Java Development Kit version 8 or higher (which you can obtain from <a class="ulink" href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/">http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/</a>) for your operating system  to work through all the examples. This book discusses the Oracle HotSpot JVM, so you may want to get Oracle JDK or OpenJDK (or Zulu) if possible. You should also get the latest Leiningen version from <a class="ulink" href="http://leiningen.org/">http://leiningen.org/</a>, and JD-GUI from <a class="ulink" href="http://jd.benow.ca/">http://jd.benow.ca/</a>.</p><p>You’ll also need a text editor or an integrated development environment (IDE). If you already have a text editor that you prefer, you can probably use it. Navigate to <a class="ulink" href="http://dev.clojure.org/display/doc/Getting+Started">http://dev.clojure.org/display/doc/Getting+Started</a> for a list of environment-specific plugins to write code in Clojure. If you don’t have a preference, it is suggested that you use Eclipse with Counterclockwise (<a class="ulink" href="http://doc.ccw-ide.org/">http://doc.ccw-ide.org/</a>) or Light Table (<a class="ulink" href="http://lighttable.com/">http://lighttable.com/</a>). Some examples in this book will also require a web browser, such as Chrome (42 or above), Firefox (38 or above), or Microsoft Internet Explorer (9 or above).</p></div>
