- en: The overall goal of this book is to provide you with an extensive toolbox of
    hands-on development tips for jMonkeyEngine that will help you be well prepared
    for a wide range of projects.

- en: The recipes are written from a practical point of view, and I strived to make
    sure that each recipe has an outcome that can be used directly in a game. An exception
    to this is [Chapter 7](ch07.html "Chapter 7. Networking with SpiderMonkey"), *Networking
    with SpiderMonkey*, where we will start from the absolute ground level and work
    ourselves upwards. [Chapter 1](ch01.html "Chapter 1. SDK Game Development Hub"),
    *SDK Game Development Hub*, also stands out as it contains a few more general
    tips applicable to development in general.

- en: Due to the variation in game projects, another principle has been used to create
    recipes that have a wide usage potential. Some of the more advanced recipes are
    exceptions to this rule. They have a more narrow use but contain techniques that
    can be applied to other implementations. FPS, RTS, and RPG games will be explored
    in many of the recipes. Naturally, within these genres, games differ widely as
    well, but hopefully you will find that the examples can be used in your game project
    with a minimum amount of modification.

    overcome common hurdles in game projects so that you can focus on the creative
    parts that make your game stand out.

- en: 'Some common development concepts in jMonkeyEngine are as follows:'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Spatial**: Central to all things in the scene graph is the Spatial. In jMonkeyEngine,
    it''s an abstract class, defining translation (location), rotation, and scale
    of an object. Imagine it as a purely logical object without a physical body. A
    Spatial is extended into either a Geometry or Node.'
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Geometry**: This extends Spatial. This class is what gives a Spatial its
    physical presence in the world. It has a Mesh defining its form and shape, and
    a Material, telling us what the surface of the Mesh looks like.'
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Node**: This extends Spatial. It can have several children attached, and
    can in turn be attached to a parent. Since it''s a Spatial, it has a translation,
    rotation, and scale, which it will propagate to its children. Unlike a Geometry,
    it can''t have a Mesh. It doesn''t have a visible presence in itself.'
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Transforms**: Translation, rotation, and scale are commonly referred to as
    a Spatial''s transforms. A Spatial has both local and world transforms. The local
    transform is always in relation to its parent (if any). The world transform is
    the absolute transform with all possible parent transforms propagated together.
    As an example, imagine your own local translation being the position you have
    on Earth. Your world translation could be your local translation added to the
    Earth''s local translation in its orbit around the Sun. Normally, you will only
    work with local transforms. World transforms are handled by the engine.'
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Mesh**: This is made up of triangles. In a Mesh, you will find long lists
    called buffers detailing the points of these triangles (vertices), how the surfaces
    of these triangles are made (indices), their colors, normal, and other data. Normally,
    you will load a model from disk, not having to care about what it looks like on
    this level, but some recipes will create meshes from scratch, and I recommend
    having a basic understanding of meshes when you do 3D game development.'
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Material**: This defines the surface of the Mesh. It''s backed by a **Material
    Definition** (**MatDef**), usually containing a vertex shader and a fragment shader.
    The complexity stretches from simply setting a color or texture for a mesh, to
    ones that alter the shape of the Mesh. You will get far by using jMonkeyEngine''s
    predefined MatDef.'
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'These are some of the basic *must-know* concepts of the engine. The following
    concepts can be considered *nice-to-know*. I know from experience that these are
    the ones you wish you had known when your applications were in the process of
    being developed. They will also be used quite frequently throughout the chapters
    of this book:'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**AppState**: This is an object that affects the behavior of the whole application,
    and you can, for example, use them to specify logic for different parts of the
    application. An example could be if you have a game that is played out both on
    a campaign map and on the ground, both player input and game logic would probably
    differ quite a lot. By using the AppState class, you can manage the code more
    easily and avoid monstrous classes.'
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Control**: Like AppState, this is a good way to manage your code. The Control
    affects the Spatial it''s attached to, and is commonly used to give Spatials special
    functionalities. You will see several examples of Control behavior in many of
    the chapters, so if you prefer learning-by-doing, you''re in for a treat.'

    go through some common concepts in the following pages to give you a basic introduction
    to 3D game development. If you'd like more in-depth descriptions of these (and
