			<h1 id="_idParaDest-5"><a id="_idTextAnchor004"/>Preface</h1>
			<p>Welcome to <em class="italic">Java Concurrency and Parallelism</em>, which explores Java’s concurrency and parallelism within the context of modern cloud computing. As technology evolves, mastering these concepts is crucial for developing robust, scalable, and efficient <span class="No-Break">cloud-native applications.</span></p>
			<p>This book is structured into three distinct yet interconnected parts, each aimed at providing in-depth knowledge and practical skills to enhance your proficiency in Java concurrency. <em class="italic">Part 1</em> lays the groundwork by introducing the fundamental principles of concurrency and parallelism, essential for any modern software development. This section covers the basics of Java concurrency, including threads and processes, and delves into advanced topics such as the <strong class="source-inline">java.util.concurrent</strong> package, the Fork/Join framework, and parallel streams. It also explores practical implementation strategies and concurrency patterns tailored for cloud environments, equipping you with the foundational tools needed to tackle the unique challenges of cloud-native <span class="No-Break">Java applications.</span></p>
			<p><em class="italic">Part 2</em> builds on the foundational knowledge from <em class="italic">Part 1</em>, focusing on how Java’s concurrency capabilities address complex challenges across various specialized domains. This part examines Java’s role in big data, machine learning, microservices, and serverless computing. Through practical examples, code snippets, and real-world use cases, it demonstrates how to harness Java’s concurrency features to build scalable, high-performance applications in these <span class="No-Break">cutting-edge fields.</span></p>
			<p><em class="italic">Part 3</em> synthesizes the knowledge from the previous sections, applying it to the advanced realm of cloud computing. It covers synchronization with cloud auto-scaling, and advanced concurrency practices and explores emerging trends such as edge computing and quantum computing. This section prepares you to leverage Java’s concurrency capabilities to their fullest potential, enabling you to stay at the forefront of technological advancements in <span class="No-Break">cloud computing.</span></p>
