This was a superlative but a futuristically interesting tweet I came across recently. The impact of information technology on business in recent years has been overwhelming. They are like two large galaxies in our universe, colliding and merging. The current state of this merger can be defined by one term - collaboration. Businesspeople collaborate with information technology (IT) people and use IT services to continuously improve and deliver commercially viable and profitable product/services to their customers.</p><p>Collaboration quintessentially needs effective communication, and <span class="strong"><strong>Business Process Modeling</strong></span> smoothly<a id="id0" class="indexterm"/> fits into this scenario. Business process modeling is not new; business people have always used it. Models were developed in mind, and then, they were written down as text or depicted as diagrams. With IT embracing business, these models evolved into standard flow charts and activity diagrams. However, there was ambiguity; the diagrams and text provided by business as requirements were interpreted by the technical people and they had their own representation, architectural models, requirement documents, and design. This was duplication of effort and people, intensive, often with a line of meetings between business stakeholders and information technologists negotiating, and arriving at conclusions about the business requirements. This being the scenario, what improvement does business process modeling bring to the table? Business process modeling brings in the concept of a common artifact between business and information technologists. </p><p>Business models are prepared by business analysts and shared with technologists. They collaborate and improve on the model and arrive at an artifact that is executable. Further, technologists as always reduce their work by automating their involvement; that is, we are moving largely to software systems where business people can configure the business process and execute it without the intervention of an information technologist.</p><p>Concluding the <a id="id1" class="indexterm"/>philosophy, let us jump to the larger context of <span class="strong"><strong>Business Process Management</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong>BPM</strong></span>) and discuss it in detail. This chapter covers the following concepts:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Business process management concepts</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">The standard – business process model and notation (BPMN 2.0)</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Use cases of BPM as applied in the industry</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Design patterns in the BPM world</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">A brief introduction to jBPM</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Business logic integration platform, the bigger picture</li></ul></div><div class="section" title="Business process management"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl1sec08"/>Business process management</h1></div></div></div><p>BPM involves the designing, modeling, executing, monitoring, and optimizing of business processes. A specialized software system that helps achieve these objectives completely is called <span class="strong"><strong>Business Process Management System</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong>BPMS</strong></span>). Most of the IT infrastructure used in business<a id="id2" class="indexterm"/> is in fact part of one or more business processes, and a BPMS should have the capability to manage the complete life cycle of a business management process. Further, jBPM provides a complete BPMS.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/9578OS_01_01.jpg" alt="Business process management"/></div><p>A business process consists of a set of activities, organized to complete a specific business objective, which varies from <span class="emphasis"><em>creating a product</em></span> to <span class="emphasis"><em>delivering a service</em></span>. A business process <a id="id3" class="indexterm"/>model also provides a visual representation of the business processes. The activities in a business process (also called tasks) are connected to represent the execution flow of a business process; further, these activities can be categorized.</p><p>jBPM helps its<a id="id4" class="indexterm"/> users to define and model business processes by using its process designers. Business users can in fact design the business process online, and efficient versioning and history capabilities help in making the activity of modeling business processes collaborative. There are provisions to simulate how a business process might behave during runtime. jBPM also provides capabilities to migrate the process definition to an updated version when business changes stipulate process improvements.</p><p>The defined business process models are deployed to BPM software, where instances of these process definitions are created to execute the process. jBPM provides the capability of executing business processes and has complete operation management capabilities such as tracking, controlling, and maintaining the history of the life cycle of all process instances.</p><div class="section" title="Human interaction management"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl2sec07"/>Human interaction management</h2></div></div></div><p>An important<a id="id5" class="indexterm"/> concept that we need to discuss in detail while explaining BPMS is <span class="strong"><strong>Human Interaction Management</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong>HIM</strong></span>). The activities that form business processes can be broadly classified into <span class="strong"><strong>automatic</strong></span> and <span class="strong"><strong>manual</strong></span>. Automatic activities are those that can be completed by the software <a id="id6" class="indexterm"/>system without <a id="id7" class="indexterm"/>any manual intervention. For example, in a banking transaction process, the customer has to provide the details of the transaction, such as the bank account number to which the money needs to be transferred and the amount to be credited into this account. This is a manual activity. In contrast, if an SMS alert needs to be sent to the customer's mobile as part of this process, no manual intervention is needed; the software can fetch the mobile number registered with the customer's account and send the SMS automatically. An SMS alert is an automatic activity in the banking transaction process.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/9578OS_01_02.jpg" alt="Human interaction management"/></div><p>Therefore, human tasks are in fact human interactions in the business processes or, in a broader sense, human interactions with the software system in place. Usually, human activities are physical tasks that are performed outside the software system and the results or conclusions are then fed as input into the software system. Technically, from the perspective of the system, we can say that the associated human activities would provide an input to the business process and there would be scenarios where the business process would be able to continue only after manual decisions. For example, in a banking transaction business process, the customer has to provide a one-time password to continue the process.</p><p>A <span class="strong"><strong>Human Interaction Management System </strong></span>(<span class="strong"><strong>HIMS</strong></span>) should have the capability to handle the <a id="id8" class="indexterm"/>life cycle of a human activity, which includes notifying the users who are associated with the activity, collecting information or results from the users, and keeping track of the history of the tasks. The information collected from human interactions is used in process execution and decision making. jBPM has an in-built human task service and can be integrated with any other HIMS. The in-built human task service of jBPM is in compliance with the WS-Human Task specification.</p><p>jBPM also <a id="id9" class="indexterm"/>provides a form modeling feature that helps business analysts to design user interface forms that can be attached to the jBPM user task, using which information about the completion of the user task (if any) can be collected.</p></div><div class="section" title="Business activity monitoring"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl2sec08"/>Business activity monitoring</h2></div></div></div><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Business Activity Monitoring</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong>BAM</strong></span>) provides online monitoring capabilities for business activities and enables businesses to arrive at key performance pointers by slicing and dicing the <a id="id10" class="indexterm"/>activity event data. BAM refers to a general software system that can monitor business processes, but attaching BAM with a BPM-based software system is relatively easy and powerful. In general, BAM software has the capability to show business data using dashboards, enabling business users to create customer reports and charts for performance indicators and trend analysis.</p><p>The jBPM core engine stores the process and task history and provides APIs to perform the BAM operations. Further, the jBPM tooling includes the dashboard builder, which enables its users to create custom dashboards from the business process history.</p><p>Consider a banking transaction process where a customer carries out a transaction from his/her account to another account. By analyzing the process history logs, the business user can create trend analysis reports of the peak hours of the day at which the maximum number of transactions took place. This analysis can be used to optimize related IT costs.</p><p>Another more frequent use case where BAM is applied is the optimization of a business process by avoiding process bottlenecks. Process bottlenecks can be caused by various problems including resource shortage (insufficient supply of staff) or a system not performing up-to-the-mark. A resource shortage problem would be quite obvious, but a system inefficiency may not be very apparent. For example, suppose that the <span class="strong"><strong>One-Time Password</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong>OTP</strong></span>) activity<a id="id11" class="indexterm"/> in a banking transaction process is often delayed. Let us say it takes more than one minute, which prompts users to perform the transaction again (or use the resend option) and leads to customer dissatisfaction. This also leads to wastage of resources by sending multiple OTPs; in other words, a delayed OTP confuses the customer and the bank further loses its credibility. Such issues are often noticed by banks when diligent<a id="id12" class="indexterm"/> customers notify them about the issues. BAMs can make the corrections of these issues more proactive, leading to increased customer satisfaction.</p></div><div class="section" title="Business process simulation"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl2sec09"/>Business process simulation</h2></div></div></div><p>Business process simulation provides the business user with the ability to see how the business process <a id="id13" class="indexterm"/>model created by them would work during runtime. Simulation is a term that goes hand-in-hand with modeling. A model designer would really love to have a simulator to test his model and understand the runtime impacts of his/her model. Business process simulation is the capability to analyze the runtime behavior of business processes. It helps in the optimization of business process models for quality, performance, and resource utilization.</p><p>Comparing business process simulation with the more regular models of testing these processes, we find that the user has to manually test these processes after deploying them in a <span class="strong"><strong>Quality Assurance</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong>QA</strong></span>) environment. Further, for automated verification, the user would<a id="id14" class="indexterm"/> have to rely on a programmer to script the automated test cases. In both cases, the process of verification is not carried out locally with the modeling process and delayed results mean iterations for corrections, adding to the cost of process improvements.</p><p>Business process simulation provides business users with the ability to see how the business process model created by them would work during runtime. The users can provide the simulation information, which includes the input to the processes, interrupts, and resource information to be used in the simulation mode. While executing the simulation, the software collects the statistical information about the running process, and this information can be analyzed by the users to optimize their business model.</p><p>jBPM is an <a id="id15" class="indexterm"/>early adopter and implementer of the <span class="strong"><strong>Business Process Simulation Interchange Standard</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong>BPSim</strong></span>). BPSim provides a standardized specification that allows business process models to be analyzed using a computer interpretable representation or a meta model. Using jBPM, the end user can provide the metadata for simulation by using the process designer and execute simulations to view the execution paths and the performance metrics associated with the various execution paths.</p></div></div></div>
<div class="section" title="The business process model and notation"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl1sec09"/>The business process model and notation</h1></div></div></div><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Business Process Model and Notation</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong>BPMN</strong></span>) is the widely accepted standard for business <a id="id16" class="indexterm"/>process modeling and provides a graphical notation for specifying business processes in a <span class="strong"><strong>Business Process Diagram</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong>BPD</strong></span>). It is based on a flowcharting technique very <a id="id17" class="indexterm"/>similar to the activity diagrams of <span class="strong"><strong>Unified Modeling Language</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong>UML</strong></span>). BPMN is maintained by <span class="strong"><strong>Object Management Group</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong>OMG</strong></span>), and <a id="id18" class="indexterm"/>the current version is 2.0 (released in March 2011).</p><p>The <a id="id19" class="indexterm"/>primary goal of BPMN is to provide a standard notation readily understandable by business stakeholders. These include business analysts who create and refine the processes, technical developers responsible for implementing these processes, and operation managers who monitor and manage the processes. Consequently, BPMN serves as a common language, bridging the communication gap that frequently occurs between business process design and implementation. BPMN also serves as a communication medium between organizations who partner for achieving common business goals, to share functional processes and procedures.</p><p>One<a id="id20" class="indexterm"/> of the main differences between BPMN and other process definition standards such as <span class="strong"><strong>Business Process Execution Language</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong>BPEL</strong></span>) is that BPMN supports human interaction. Human<a id="id21" class="indexterm"/> interaction support provides completeness to business process modeling, as humans are the primary actors in any business organization. Being a specification of visual programming notations, BPMN places considerable emphasis on diagrammatic representations of the elements of the business process model. So, a reader of a BPMN diagram can easily recognize the basic type of elements and understand the business process. BPMN conformance ensures a common visual representation, although it allows variations without dramatically changing the basic look and feel of the diagram.</p><p>The detailed explanation of the BPMN 2.0 specification can be found in the specification document.</p><div class="note" title="Note" style=""><div class="inner"><h3 class="title"><a id="note02"/>Note</h3><p>BPMN<a id="id22" class="indexterm"/> specification documents can be found at <a class="ulink" href="http://www.bpmn.org/">http://www.bpmn.org/</a>.</p></div></div><p>Conformance to standard BPMN specification defines four types of conformance:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Process modeling conformance</strong></span>: Tools claiming conformance must support BPMN<a id="id23" class="indexterm"/> core elements, human interactions, pools, and<a id="id24" class="indexterm"/> message flows.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Process execution conformance</strong></span>: Tools claiming conformance must support and<a id="id25" class="indexterm"/> interpret operational semantics and activity life cycle as stated in the specification.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>BPEL process execution conformance</strong></span>: A special type of process execution conformance<a id="id26" class="indexterm"/> that supports BPMN mapping to WS-BPEL.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Choreography modeling conformance</strong></span>: Tools claiming conformance must support <a id="id27" class="indexterm"/>choreography diagrams and their elements. Choreography diagrams focus on the collaboration of different groups in activities and the message flow between them.</li></ul></div><p>A jBPM implementation partially claims the first two types of conformance, namely process modeling conformance and process execution conformance. Although jBPM supports all core elements in process modeling, it does not support all the elements described in the specification.</p><div class="section" title="Core elements"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl2sec10"/>Core elements</h2></div></div></div><p>The <a id="id28" class="indexterm"/>chief constituents of a BPMN diagram, BPMN elements, can be broadly classified into five categories:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Flow Objects</strong></span>: These <a id="id29" class="indexterm"/>objects define<a id="id30" class="indexterm"/> the behavior of a business process</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Data</strong></span>: This<a id="id31" class="indexterm"/> represents the data associated in the<a id="id32" class="indexterm"/> business process</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Connecting Objects</strong></span>: These<a id="id33" class="indexterm"/> objects <a id="id34" class="indexterm"/>are used to connect the flow objects to each other</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Swimlanes</strong></span>: This <a id="id35" class="indexterm"/>is used to categorize<a id="id36" class="indexterm"/> the flow objects</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Artifacts</strong></span>: These<a id="id37" class="indexterm"/> provide additional information <a id="id38" class="indexterm"/>about the process</li></ul></div><div class="section" title="Flow Objects"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl3sec01"/>Flow Objects</h3></div></div></div><p>Flow objects<a id="id39" class="indexterm"/> are the meat of BPMN; they are used to define how the business process would behave. The following are the major types of flow objects:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Events</strong></span>: An<a id="id40" class="indexterm"/> event is something that happens in the course <a id="id41" class="indexterm"/>of a business process. These events affect the flow of the model and usually have a trigger for and an impact on the business process. Some examples of events are Start, Stop, and Error. A Start event triggers the start of a process instance and is triggered using an explicit trigger, a message, or a timer. Events can be either signaled from a process (thrown) or can be waited upon (catch).</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Activities</strong></span>: Activities are actions performed within a business process. They can be<a id="id42" class="indexterm"/> either <a id="id43" class="indexterm"/>atomic (called Tasks) or compound (Sub-processes). An example of an activity is a user task or a service task. A user task indicates a human interaction and the action has to be taken manually to complete this task. A task can be complete upon being triggered or can wait for completion (a wait state); for example, a service task is triggered and completed, while a human task is triggered and waited upon for a user to complete the action.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Gateways</strong></span>: Gateways<a id="id44" class="indexterm"/> are used as controllers for the<a id="id45" class="indexterm"/> branching, merging, forking, and joining of execution paths within a business process. An example is the parallel gateway, which can be used to split the execution path into multiple outgoing branches, with all outgoing branches activated simultaneously. Parallel gateways can also be used to merge branches; they wait for the completion of all incoming branches to complete before triggering the outgoing flow.</li></ul></div></div><div class="section" title="Data"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl3sec02"/>Data</h3></div></div></div><p>Business <a id="id46" class="indexterm"/>process execution results in the production of data; for example, in the banking transaction process, the transaction details are data provided by the user regarding the transaction. This data would have to be saved or transferred to another activity for further processing. The following elements are the core of data modeling in <a id="id47" class="indexterm"/>BPMN.</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Data Object</strong></span>: Data objects are data created as part of a business activity. They can be <a id="id48" class="indexterm"/>used for informational purposes to indicate that the activity produces such data.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Data Input</strong></span>: Data <a id="id49" class="indexterm"/>inputs specify the input needed for an activity for its completion. For example, an OTP sending task in the banking transaction process would need the details of the customer to send the SMS. So, the input of this activity is mapped from the output of the previous activity or from data that is globally associated with the process instance.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Data Output</strong></span>: Data <a id="id50" class="indexterm"/>outputs are data resulting from an activity that have to be mapped to a global process variable or to serve as input to a subsequent activity.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Data Store</strong></span>: A <a id="id51" class="indexterm"/>data store provides a mechanism for activities to retrieve or update stored information that persists beyond the scope of the process.</li></ul></div></div><div class="section" title="Connecting Objects"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl3sec03"/>Connecting Objects</h3></div></div></div><p>Flow objects<a id="id52" class="indexterm"/> are connected to each other by using connecting objects. The following are the types of connecting objects:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Sequence Flows</strong></span>: A <a id="id53" class="indexterm"/>sequence flow is <a id="id54" class="indexterm"/>the basic element used to represent a connection. It is used to connect flow objects and defines the execution order of activities.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Message Flows</strong></span>: Message flows <a id="id55" class="indexterm"/>are used to <a id="id56" class="indexterm"/>represent information flow across organizational boundaries (a group of activities within an organization or a department, or a role of users).</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Associations</strong></span>: Associations<a id="id57" class="indexterm"/> are used to represent<a id="id58" class="indexterm"/> the association of data or an artifact to a flow object.</li></ul></div></div><div class="section" title="Swimlanes"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl3sec04"/>Swimlanes</h3></div></div></div><p>Swimlanes<a id="id59" class="indexterm"/> are a visual mechanism for organizing and categorizing activities and form the basis of cross-functional charts using BPMN. They represent an organization, a role or, a system. They are basically of the following two types:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Pools</strong></span>: A pool<a id="id60" class="indexterm"/> represents the higher-level categorization of <a id="id61" class="indexterm"/>activities. For example, an organization can be represented as a pool. A pool consists of multiple lanes. An example of lanes would be the departments within an organization.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Lanes</strong></span>: A lane<a id="id62" class="indexterm"/> represents the categorization within the pool. The<a id="id63" class="indexterm"/> lane contains flow objects, connecting objects, and artifacts.</li></ul></div></div><div class="section" title="Artifacts"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl3sec05"/>Artifacts</h3></div></div></div><p>Artifacts are <a id="id64" class="indexterm"/>graphical representations that provide supporting information about the process or elements within the process. They don't interfere with the process flow; in other words, we can say that they are opaque from the perspective of process execution. The basic types of artifacts stated in the BPMN specification are as follows:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Group</strong></span>: The <a id="id65" class="indexterm"/>Group construct can be used to logically group<a id="id66" class="indexterm"/> an arbitrary set of flow objects to show that they logically belong together</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Text Annotation</strong></span>: Text <a id="id67" class="indexterm"/>annotation can used to associate <a id="id68" class="indexterm"/>additional documentation with any element in a BPMN diagram</li></ul></div><p>The banking transaction process is illustrated in the following diagram with the core elements of event, activity, data object, lane, and gateway annotated:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/9578OS_01_03.jpg" alt="Artifacts"/></div></div></div></div>
<div class="section" title="Business process management as applied in industry"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl1sec10"/>Business process management as applied in industry</h1></div></div></div><p>BPM is typically <a id="id69" class="indexterm"/>used in industries where the following is true:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">The business process is distributed and spans across multiple applications or software systems</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">The process involves complex rules that have to be maintained and updated overtime</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">There is a need to continuously improve the business process by monitoring the existing activities</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">The business is done by the collaboration of multiple stakeholders</li></ul></div><p>With the above considerations, we can apply BPM to any process-oriented domain, such as healthcare, insurance, point of sales, supply chain management, and banking and financial services. A fully functional BPM system gives a huge advantage in terms of the turnaround time for an organization with a new product/service offering or an improved process.</p><p>Considering the scope of this book, we can briefly detail some domains in the upcoming sections. A <a id="id70" class="indexterm"/>detailed study of these use cases is done in the subsequent chapters, and these use cases are used throughout the book for explaining each and every aspect of jBPM.</p><div class="section" title="Supply chain management"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl2sec11"/>Supply chain management</h2></div></div></div><p>A supply chain is an interconnected set of business procedures and business partners that manages the <a id="id71" class="indexterm"/>flow of goods and information from the point of <a id="id72" class="indexterm"/>design to the delivery of the product and/or service to the end customer. The supply chain provides a well-coordinated channel to organizations for delivering their products and services to the end customer. Supply chain typical include the following:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Suppliers</strong></span>: They<a id="id73" class="indexterm"/> supply the raw materials.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Manufacturers</strong></span>: They <a id="id74" class="indexterm"/>manufacture the product.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Distributors</strong></span>: They <a id="id75" class="indexterm"/>distributes the product for sale to the retailers.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Retailers</strong></span>: They <a id="id76" class="indexterm"/>sell the product to the end customers.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Customers</strong></span>: They buy and use the product. Therefore, a supply chain is a collaboration<a id="id77" class="indexterm"/> of multiple functional units, and these groups can be within the same organization or from different business units. Coordinating the jobs and meeting end user expectations in a cost-effective manner is a challenge and is attributed to supply chain management systems. As you can see, the domain is inherently process oriented, with a lot of complex rules and regulations governing each stage of the process, and this is a best-fit domain for applying complete BPM systems.</li></ul></div><p>A few processes<a id="id78" class="indexterm"/> to name in the supply chain domain are as follows:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Manufacturing flow management</strong></span>: This deals with the manufacturing of products and/or provision of services</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Order management</strong></span>: This meets customer requirements in terms of order fulfillment</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Customer service management</strong></span>: This provides real-time information about product <a id="id79" class="indexterm"/>availability, shipping dates, and order status</li></ul></div><p>Order management is a core process in the supply chain domain. The process depicted in the next figure is a trivial process but is intended to exemplify the ease and clarity that a business process brings to the table, particularly to a cross-functional business process. From the<a id="id80" class="indexterm"/> process diagram itself, any layman can understand the<a id="id81" class="indexterm"/> cross-functional units in the organization and, of course, the flow. Thus, the users, both business analysts and operations users, can understand the bigger picture more easily, thereby improving the overall communication and efficiency.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/9578OS_01_04.jpg" alt="Supply chain management"/></div><p>Payment is an activity but has the size and complexity of a separate process. Further, if we apply the rule of responsibility, a payment needs to be clearly abstracted as a separate process that can be reused across the processes of the organization for processing a payment.

<div class="section" title="Design patterns in business process modeling"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl1sec11"/>Design patterns in business process modeling</h1></div></div></div><p>Design patterns are solutions to commonly occurring problems in their corresponding domain. Business process models try to map general business processes and procedures by using a <a id="id92" class="indexterm"/>standard set of elements. The design <a id="id93" class="indexterm"/>patterns provided next are solutions for certain commonly occurring problems in business process modeling.</p><p>The section focuses on providing an introduction to the design patterns that were identified in the business process modeling domain. Understanding these patterns would help you <a id="id94" class="indexterm"/>in identifying solutions easily to<a id="id95" class="indexterm"/> the problems you are trying to map using BPMS. The following list of patterns is found in the pattern templates provided by the jBPM designer tools.</p><div class="section" title="Sequence"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl2sec13"/>Sequence</h2></div></div></div><p>Sequence is the<a id="id96" class="indexterm"/> most basic pattern that <a id="id97" class="indexterm"/>occurs in business process modeling, using which tasks to be executed sequentially, one after another, can be modeled.</p><p>jBPM supports this by connecting the task using sequence flow connectors, which provide a sequential ordering of the tasks.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/9578OS_01_06.jpg" alt="Sequence"/></div><p>The preceding figure illustrates a part of the loan processing in the banking domain, which represents a sequence pattern problem. Activities such as collecting loan information, validations, and sending for authorization have to be done sequentially; these activities can be allocated to separate human users or even to system automated tasks.</p></div><div class="section" title="Parallel split"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl2sec14"/>Parallel split</h2></div></div></div><p>A parallel split<a id="id98" class="indexterm"/> pattern is used for splitting the branch of execution to more than two branches in such a way that each of the outgoing branches is executed in parallel.</p><p>jBPM supports <a id="id99" class="indexterm"/>a parallel split pattern by using a parallel gateway, in which all outgoing branches are activated simultaneously.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/9578OS_01_07.jpg" alt="Parallel split"/></div><p>The preceding figure shows a scenario in the order fulfillment process, where a parallel split pattern is applicable. During the ordering process, after providing the order details the shipment of the order and the invoice sending, payments may be parallel paths of processes. The parallel split pattern fits in here, solving the problem.</p></div><div class="section" title="Synchronization"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl2sec15"/>Synchronization</h2></div></div></div><p>A synchronization<a id="id100" class="indexterm"/> pattern is<a id="id101" class="indexterm"/> just the other end of the parallel split design patterns; it merges two or more branches in such a way that the merged branch would run only after the execution of all incoming branches that are to join.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/9578OS_01_08.jpg" alt="Synchronization"/></div><p>The <a id="id102" class="indexterm"/>preceding figure shows the<a id="id103" class="indexterm"/> continuation of the example from the parallel split pattern, after the parallel process paths for shipment and payment making are completed, there is a close order activity to be done. Notice that the close order activity has to be done after the completion of both the payment and the shipment activities.</p></div><div class="section" title="Simple merge"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl2sec16"/>Simple merge</h2></div></div></div><p>The <a id="id104" class="indexterm"/>simple merge pattern <a id="id105" class="indexterm"/>provides a way to merge two or more branches in a process definition into a single path of execution. This is particularly useful in scenarios where there are two or more paths to reach a common set of activities. We can avoid duplicating these common set of activities by using a simple merge pattern.</p><p>In jBPM, single merge can be realized by using an XOR or exclusive gateway, which awaits one incoming branch to complete before triggering the outgoing flow.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/9578OS_01_09.jpg" alt="Simple merge"/></div><p>The<a id="id106" class="indexterm"/> preceding example process, which <a id="id107" class="indexterm"/>deals with changing the password of an online banking customer, fits nicely with the problem statement of a simple merge. As illustrated in the diagram, for ensuring security, the user is given two options, either provide the debit card details or answer a security question. After giving either of these options, password confirmation occurs. The exclusive gateway (before the <span class="strong"><strong>Confirm Password</strong></span> activity) provides control to the confirm password activity after the completion of either of the parallel activities.</p></div><div class="section" title="Exclusive choice"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl2sec17"/>Exclusive choice</h2></div></div></div><p>Exclusive choice<a id="id108" class="indexterm"/> patterns<a id="id109" class="indexterm"/> provide a solution to diverging a branch into more than one branch (or path of execution) such that after the completion of the incoming branch, the flow of execution is handed over to precisely one branch on the basis of the condition of branching.</p><p>In jBPM, this pattern can be implemented using the data-based exclusive (XOR) gateway. The XOR gateway splits and routes the execution to exactly one branch on the basis of the branch condition provided.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/9578OS_01_10.jpg" alt="Exclusive choice"/></div><p>The preceding figure illustrates a scenario for exclusive choice. The sample is a part of a process for making an online transaction. After entering the password based on a validation<a id="id110" class="indexterm"/> in the exclusive <a id="id111" class="indexterm"/>gateway with the condition, the selection of the path to continue is made. This pattern is similar to a decision box in a flowchart.</p></div><div class="section" title="Implicit termination"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl2sec18"/>Implicit termination</h2></div></div></div><p>The <a id="id112" class="indexterm"/>implicit termination<a id="id113" class="indexterm"/> pattern enables a user to terminate the process from any branch. The process engine verifies the completed workitems and decides the termination of the process. This largely avoids clutter because otherwise we have to design the process in such a way that these paths join at a single point of termination. The complexity of such a design would increase with the increasing number of paths in the process.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/9578OS_01_11.jpg" alt="Implicit termination"/></div><p>The previous figure shows a process with two terminations or termination events attached. Here, either after completion of <span class="strong"><strong>Task B</strong></span> or after completion of <span class="strong"><strong>Task C</strong></span>, the process terminates.</p><p>If implicit termination is not supported by the BPMN implementation, users can achieve the termination by merging the paths to a common termination, and is called as explicit termination.. The following figure shows the explicit termination:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/9578OS_01_12.jpg" alt="Implicit termination"/></div><p>Referring <a id="id114" class="indexterm"/>the preceding<a id="id115" class="indexterm"/> figure, we can see that  a  gateway is used to achieve  a common termination point. The results of the process execution in the previous two cases are the same, but the second solution (explicit termination) is more complex.</p></div><div class="section" title="Deferred choice"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl2sec19"/>Deferred choice</h2></div></div></div><p>Deferred choice<a id="id116" class="indexterm"/> gives a<a id="id117" class="indexterm"/> business process the ability to choose a path on the basis of an interaction with the operating environment. The execution control waits in the decision gateway; the path where the first task is initiated is chosen as the path of execution.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/9578OS_01_13.jpg" alt="Deferred choice"/></div><p>The preceding figure shows the implementation of a deferred choice pattern in an online banking scenario. The process is for enabling the customer to register his/her e-mail with his/her account to receive updates, account statements, and so on. After the registration, an e-mail is sent to the customer at the registered customer ID to complete registration. If the <a id="id118" class="indexterm"/>customer doesn't respond to it <a id="id119" class="indexterm"/>within a specified time period (here, <span class="strong"><strong>24 Hours</strong></span>), the registration fails.</p></div><div class="section" title="Multiple instance without synchronization"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl2sec20"/>Multiple instance without synchronization</h2></div></div></div><p>By using the <span class="strong"><strong>Multiple Instance</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong>MI</strong></span>) facility, we can create multiple instances of a task. These<a id="id120" class="indexterm"/> instances are independent of each other. There is no requirement to synchronize<a id="id121" class="indexterm"/> the execution flow after the <a id="id122" class="indexterm"/>multiple instance execution, unlike a merge.</p><p>jBPM allows us to model a multiple instance sub-process, which can be used to implement the MI patterns. An example is shown in the following figure:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/9578OS_01_14.jpg" alt="Multiple instance without synchronization"/></div><p>After the execution of <span class="strong"><strong>Task A</strong></span>, the <span class="strong"><strong>Task B</strong></span> execution is done by using a collection expression used to define <span class="strong"><strong>B Multiple Instance Sub process</strong></span>. Multiple instances of <span class="strong"><strong>Task B</strong></span> are executed depending on the number of items provided in the collection expression. <span class="strong"><strong>Task C</strong></span> is executed without waiting for the execution completion of <span class="strong"><strong>Task B</strong></span> (or instances of <span class="strong"><strong>Task B</strong></span>). This pattern is particularly useful when multiple tasks need to be run in a <span class="emphasis"><em>fire-and forget</em></span>-manner.</p><p>For example, in a process, we have to send e-mails to a set of users (say subscribers for an incident). Here, the collection expression would be the list of subscribers. The multiple instance <a id="id123" class="indexterm"/>task (send e-mail task) would <a id="id124" class="indexterm"/>send e-mails to each subscriber.</p></div><div class="section" title="Synchronized merge"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl2sec21"/>Synchronized merge</h2></div></div></div><p>Synchronized merge provides a controlled way for merging a branched execution flow. The<a id="id125" class="indexterm"/> execution flow is <a id="id126" class="indexterm"/>merged when all incoming "active" branches are completed.</p><p>jBPM implements this pattern by using the inclusive gateway. Inclusive gateways, upon splitting, activate one or more branches on the basis of the branching conditions. Upon merging, it waits for all active incoming branches to complete.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/9578OS_01_15.jpg" alt="Synchronized merge"/></div><p>The preceding process illustrates a synchronized merge scenario. Based on the condition for the levels of approval, one or more levels of approval may be required. The second inclusive gateway ensures that the control to the next activity is done after all active approvals are done.</p><div class="section" title="Arbitrary cycle"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl3sec06"/>Arbitrary cycle</h3></div></div></div><p>Arbitrary cycle <a id="id127" class="indexterm"/>patterns address the need for repetition <a id="id128" class="indexterm"/>of tasks in a process model in an unstructured manner, without the need of explicit constructs such as loop operators. This pattern helps in representing process models that require a cycle in a visually readable format.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/9578OS_01_16.jpg" alt="Arbitrary cycle"/></div><p>The preceding figure shows that tasks can be cyclically connected using connectors and gateways.</p></div></div></div>

The following figure provides a bird's eye view of a possible solution architecture where we use these tools together.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/9578OS_01_19.jpg" alt="Working together"/></div><p>Together, they enable business analysts to write and manage applications by mapping business scenarios<a id="id170" class="indexterm"/> to process definitions, rule definitions for decisions, and rules including temporal logic.</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic"><li class="listitem">The designer tools enable business analysts to map the business scenarios required for a solution to rules, processes, events, or related artifacts.</li><li class="listitem">The applications/users can interact with the solution by using the operation management tooling provided by jBPM, or they can use the RESTful web service interface to access the same from their proprietary applications.</li><li class="listitem">The runtime integrates the business processing, rule inference, and temporal reasoning capabilities to infer decisions and take actions for a business scenario.</li><li class="listitem">The knowledge repository module provides storage, version management, deployment, and testing of the applications developed.</li></ol></div><p>Another important thing I want to highlight from the preceding figure is the technology platforms used by the individual tools. The web-based user interface for process designing and operation management is developed using the UberFire framework; the Eclipse-based tooling is based on eclipse RCP; the runtime is based on the Kie framework; and Guvnor is based on virtual file system-based storage and by default uses Git. The details of these technology platforms so as to customize and extend jBPM will be discussed in <a class="link" href="ch07.html" title="Chapter 7. Customizing and Extending jBPM">Chapter 7</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Customizing and Extending jBPM</em></span>.</p><p>Red Hat also<a id="id171" class="indexterm"/> provides a commercially supported flavor of this package and is called Red Hat JBoss BPM Suite.</p></div></div>
<div class="section" title="Summary"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl1sec14"/>Summary</h1></div></div></div><p>The goal of this chapter was to give you a picture of the world of BPM. We explored the basic concepts, the standard, patterns, use cases where BPM is applied in the industry, and its benefits. We also explored the jBPM tool stack and the bigger picture of BLIP. These concepts and tools will be discussed in detail throughout this book.</p><p>In the next chapter, we will discuss how to install the jBPM tool stack and create our first business process-centric application using jBPM.</p></div></body></html>
