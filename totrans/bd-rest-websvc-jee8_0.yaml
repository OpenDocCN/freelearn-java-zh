- en: Java Enterprise Edition is one of the leading application programming platforms
    for enterprise Java development. With Java EE 8 finally released and the first
    application servers being available, it is time to have a closer look at how to
    develop modern and lightweight web services with the latest API additions and
    improvements.

- en: This book is a comprehensive guide that shows you how to develop state-of-the-art
    RESTful web services with the latest Java EE 8 APIs. We start by giving an overview
    of Java EE 8 and the latest API additions and improvements. Then, you will implement,
    build, and package your first working web service as a prototype for the remainder
    of the book. It delves into the details of implementing synchronous RESTful web
    services and clients with JAX-RS. Next up, you will learn about the specifics
    of data binding and content marshaling using the JSON-B 1.0 and JSON-P 1.1 APIs.
    You will then learn how to leverage the power of asynchronous APIs on both the
    server and client sides, and you will learn how to use **Server-Sent Events**
    (**SSEs**) for `PUSH` communications. The final chapter covers some advanced web
    service topics, such as validation, JWT security, and diagnosing web services.

    EE 8 APIs required for lightweight web service development. Also, you will have
    implemented several working web services to provide you with the required practical
    experience.
