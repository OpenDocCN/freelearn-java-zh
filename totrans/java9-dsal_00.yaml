- en: Java has been one of the most popular programming languages for enterprise systems
    for decades now. One of the reasons for the popularity of Java is its platform
    independence, which lets one write and compile code on any system and run it on
    any other system, irrespective of the hardware and the operating system. Another
    reason for Java's popularity is that the language is standardized by a community
    of industry players. The latter enables Java to stay updated with the most recent
    programming ideas without being overloaded with too many useless features.

- en: Given the popularity of Java, there are plenty of developers actively involved
    in Java development. When it comes to learning algorithms, it is best to use the
    language that one is most comfortable with. This means that it makes a lot of
    sense to write an algorithm book, with the implementations written in Java. This
    book covers the most commonly used data structures and algorithms. It is meant
    for people who already know Java but are not familiar with algorithms. The book
    should serve as the first stepping stone towards learning the subject.

    "Chapter 1. Why Bother? – Basic"), *Why Bother? – Basic*, introduces the point
    of studying algorithms and data structures with examples. In doing so, it introduces
    you to the concept of asymptotic complexity, big O notation, and other notations.'

    Blocks*, introduces you to array and the different kinds of linked lists, and
    their advantages and disadvantages. These data structures will be used in later
    chapters for implementing abstract data structures.'

    introduces you to the concept of abstract data types and introduces stacks, queues,
    and double-ended queues. It also covers different implementations using the data
    structures described in the previous chapter.'

    introduces you to the functional programming ideas appropriate for a Java programmer.
    The chapter also introduces the lambda feature of Java, available from Java 8,
    and helps readers get used to the functional way of implementing algorithms. This
    chapter also introduces you to the concept of monads.'

    – Binary Search and Sorting*, introduces efficient searching using binary searches
    on a sorted list. It then goes on to describe basic algorithms used to obtain
    a sorted array so that binary searching can be done.'

    to the concept of reactive programming in Java. This includes the implementation
    of an observable pattern-based reactive programming framework and a functional
    API on top of it. Examples are shown to demonstrate the performance gain and ease
    of use of the reactive framework, compared with a traditional imperative style.'
