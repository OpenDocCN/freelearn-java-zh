- en: Micronaut is a JVM-based framework for building lightweight, modular applications.
    It is a fast-growing framework designed to make creating microservices quick and
    easy. This book will help full stack/Java developers to build modular, high-performing,
    and reactive microservices-based applications using Micronaut.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This book is for developers who have been building microservices on traditional
    frameworks such as Spring Boot and are looking for a faster alternative. Intermediate
    knowledge of Java programming is required, along with a intermediate knowledge
    of implementing web services development in Java.

- en: '[*Chapter 1*](B16585_01_Final_VK_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor015), *Getting Started
    with Microservices Using the Micronaut Framework*, kicks off with some conceptual
    fundamentals on microservices and microservices design patterns. You are then
    introduced to the Micronaut framework and why this is the ideal framework for
    developing microservices. Later, you will get hands-on with the Micronaut framework
    by working on hello-world projects using Maven and Gradle.'

    Data Access*, covers aspects of working with various kinds of database and persistence
    frameworks. You will begin with an object-relational mapping framework while doing
    a hands-on Hibernate framework and then dive into using a persistence framework
    (MyBatis). Finally, you will also integrate with a non-relational database (MongoDB).'

    Microservices Using Event-Driven Architecture*, starts with event-driven architecture
    and two different models for event publishing: a pull model and a push model.
    You then dive into event streaming and using Apache Kafka for integrating two
    microservices in the pet-clinic application (sample project).'

    Microservices*, sheds some light on various kinds of automated testing â€“ unit
    testing, service testing, and integration testing, and how to employ these testing
    techniques in adopting a prudent automated testing policy to reduce cost and increase
    the robustness of microservices.'

    Microservices Concerns*, covers some core concerns while working on the microservices,
    such as distributed configuration management, documenting service APIs, service
    discovery, and the API gateway. Later, you also explore the mechanisms for fault
    tolerance in the Micronaut framework.'
