    to bridge the gap between Eclipse and Maven, help to create projects using simple
    intuitive interfaces from Maven Archetypes, and launch and manage the projects
    build using a simple editor. It makes the use of Maven right from the IDE so much
    easier. Some of the features provided by m2eclipse are as follows:'

    installation discussed in [Chapter 1](part0014_split_000.html#page "Chapter 1. Apache
    Maven – Introduction and Installation"), *Apache Maven – Introduction and Installation*,
    is optional. However, to use the latest version of Maven, we are required to install
    Maven externally, as discussed in the previous chapter. We also need to make sure
    our m2eclipse plugin uses it. Also, the use of continuous integration servers
    nowadays requires us to have a common Maven version across servers, thus making
    use of the externally installed Maven.
