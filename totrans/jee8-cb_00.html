            <article class="calibre2">
                
<p class="mce-root">Java EE is a mature platform that's widely used around the world. It is also a standard that has evolved through the hard work of individuals, vendors, groups leaders, and communities. It has a whole market and ecosystem around it, with millions of users, which also means a big and active community that is always willing to help it move forward.</p>
<p class="mce-root">For those reasons, the purpose of this book is to meet the needs of those professionals who depend on Java EE to deliver really awesome enterprise solutions, not only talking about real solutions for real problems, but also showing how to do it in a practical way.</p>
<p class="mce-root">The book starts with a quick overview of what Java EE and the improvements in version 8. Then, it takes you on a hands-on journey through the most important APIs.</p>
<p class="mce-root">You will learn how to use Java EE for server-side development, web services, and web applications. You will also take a look at how you can properly improve the security of your enterprise solutions.</p>
<p class="mce-root">No Java EE application is good enough if it doesn't follow the standards, and for that, you can count on the Java EE application servers. This book will teach you how to use the most important servers on the market and take the best they have to offer for your project.</p>
<p class="mce-root">From an architectural point of view, the book will cover microservices, cloud computing, and containers. Also, it will not forget to give you all tools for building a reactive Java EE application using not only Java EE features, but also Java core features such as lambdas and completable future.</p>
<p class="mce-root">The whole Java world is all about the community, so we will also show you how community-driven professionals can improve the results of their projects and even go to higher levels in their careers.</p>
<p class="mce-root">The book was based on a concept that I call "<em class="calibre17">The Five Mistakes That Keep Java EE Professionals Away </em><em class="calibre17">From Great Projects.</em>" I am ruining my career when I don't do the following things:</p>
<ul class="calibre13">
<li class="calibre14">Keep myself up to date</li>
<li class="calibre14">Know the APIs (an overview of all of them and master the most important ones)</li>
<li class="calibre14">Know the most commonaly used Java EE application servers</li>
<li class="calibre14">Know advanced architectures</li>
<li class="calibre14">Share what I know</li>
</ul>
<p class="mce-root">So, the book is a straight, practical, and helpful solution to each one of these mistakes. I can say with confidence that dealing with them properly can change the careers and lives of many developers around the world. I know because they've changed mine, for good.</p>
