    and analysis. Automation using macros and plugins were introduced, allowing for
    infinite possibilities in processing and analysis. The topics in this book have
    been written for users who would like to start developing their own plugins and
    macros. Naturally, this book can only provide so much information within its pages,
    so this section is meant to provide some handles on how to proceed further along
    this path.

  zh: 在这本书中，我们探讨了执行图像处理和分析的许多不同方法。介绍了使用宏和插件的自动化，这为处理和分析提供了无限的可能性。本书中的主题是为那些希望开始开发自己的插件和宏的用户编写的。自然地，这本书在其页面上只能提供这么多信息，因此本节旨在提供一些如何继续沿着这条道路前进的线索。
- en: To start with, creating macros and plugins gets easier with repeated practice
    and learning from previous code (or other people's code). When creating macros,
    it is a good practice to make small macros that perform only a single step in
    processing. Then, by combining multiple macros, you can create a very versatile
    toolbox. Many useful tools in ImageJ, such as the ActionBar plugin, allow you
    to create a fast way to launch many different macros in succession. When developing
    in this fashion, make sure that you create macros that can be daisy-chained. The
    output of one macro can be used as input to the next macro and so on. This method
    will save you a lot of time, and it allows for almost any combination you wish
    to create.

  zh: 首先，通过反复练习和学习之前的代码（或他人的代码），创建宏和插件会变得更容易。在创建宏时，一个好的做法是创建执行处理中单个步骤的小宏。然后，通过组合多个宏，你可以创建一个非常通用的工具箱。ImageJ中许多有用的工具，如ActionBar插件，允许你以快速的方式连续启动许多不同的宏。以这种方式开发时，确保你创建可以串联的宏。一个宏的输出可以用作下一个宏的输入，依此类推。这种方法将为你节省大量时间，并允许你几乎创建任何你想要的组合。
- en: For plugins, a similar advice holds. When you use a specific function many times
    over, it may be worth it to create a standalone class with helpful tools that
    you use often. By instantiating the class to gain access to its methods, you can
    reuse your code in many different projects. Some of the larger ImageJ projects
    use a specific tool class or classes. For instance, MtrackJ and NeuronJ both use
    a library of methods called `imagescience.jar`. When making plugins with an interface,
    it is also a good idea to build your actual processing or analysis routines in
    separate classes, which can easily be swapped when you develop new or better techniques.

  zh: 对于插件，也有类似的建议。当你多次使用某个特定功能时，创建一个包含你常用工具的独立类可能是有价值的。通过实例化这个类来访问其方法，你可以在许多不同的项目中重用你的代码。一些较大的ImageJ项目使用特定的工具类或类。例如，MtrackJ和NeuronJ都使用一个名为`imagescience.jar`的方法库。在制作具有界面的插件时，将你的实际处理或分析程序构建在单独的类中也是一个好主意，这样在开发新的或更好的技术时可以轻松地替换。
- en: There are many good resources available online to develop macros used in image
    processing and analysis. The most basic one is the repository on the ImageJ website,
    which contains many excellent macros that perform basic and more advanced tasks
    and can be found at [http://imagej.nih.gov/ij/macros/](http://imagej.nih.gov/ij/macros/).

    by *Burger and Burge* is a comprehensive textbook that focuses on the algorithms
    used by ImageJ functions. This provides a mathematical background to some of the
    processing functions in ImageJ as well as image transformations and interpolations.
    Examples in their work are based on or extracted from ImageJ source code. Another
    good resource is Gonzalez and Woods' *Digital Image Processing*, which uses MATLAB
    for image-processing examples. It, however, also provides a mathematical background
    as well as techniques such as fuzzy logic in image processing. Many of the examples
    used can be translated to ImageJ as an exercise. A good source for algorithms
    is the *Numerical recipes* book series, which was written in the C/C++ language.
    Many of the algorithms can be translated into Java without too much hassle. Another
    resource that can help in understanding the physics of image formation, as well
    as the basics of signal processing, is *The Scientist and Engineer's Guide to
    Digital Signal Processing* by Steven Smith (available on [http://www.dspguide.com/](http://www.dspguide.com/)).

    Smith的《科学家和工程师的数字信号处理指南》（可在[http://www.dspguide.com/](http://www.dspguide.com/)找到）。
- en: Finally, if you wish to develop plugins that utilize a user interface, it is
    a good idea to look at many different plugins with interfaces. In [Chapter 8](ch08.html
    "Chapter 8. Anatomy of ImageJ Plugins"), *Anatomy of ImageJ Plugins* we looked
    at different examples of plugins with a basic and advanced interface. Some of
    these examples have a very clear and intuitive interface that can be used with
    minimal documentation. There are many good publications on good designs of interfaces
    as well as online resources that can show you examples of good and bad designs.
    Examples of published books include *Universal Principles of Design*, which examines
    common concepts in design based on experience and psychological knowledge. Another
    good resource is the book *Don't make me think, revisited*, which is written with
    web design in mind. However, the core principles are the same for desktop applications
    and ImageJ plugins.

- en: Many of the examples described in this book can be designed and built using
    the built-in editors of ImageJ and Fiji, but if you want to develop more advanced
    plugins, setting up an IDE would make you work faster. As a learning tool, an
    IDE might not be the best option. The learning curve of the IDE itself can be
    steep, and also, it can make you lazy. IDEs can be quite clever and analyze your
    code to provide automatic importing of classes, implementing the required methods,
    and variable checking and casting. These tools are handy, but it is important
    to understand what is happening when the IDE suggests these options. Of course,
    the spellchecking and completion of variable names makes sure that you will make
    fewer typos, but you should never blindly rely on it. The analysis of code can
    be quite sophisticated, but it cannot predict what the developer has in mind.
    This can sometimes result in very odd behavior or errors that may be hard to debug.

    and learning how to use a revision system, such as Git. The workflow when using
    a revision system is a little different than when just developing code directly.
    A revision system would only work if you commit your changes on a regular basis
    and provide useful commit messages. If you are the only developer on a project,
    you would not run into many problems such as difficult code mergers and conflicts,
    so the process becomes relatively straightforward. With the help of a graphical
    frontend for Git, the whole process becomes manageable and accessible, even for
    beginners.

    project. Conflicts and mergers can get complicated and resolving them may become
    hard if binary files are involved. Many IDEs have a revision system built in (many
    times, it''s under the **Team** menu, that is, in Eclipse and NetBeans). Whether
    you use the built-in system or a standalone interface, there are a few good resources
    to look at before using them. They will help in understanding what the system
    is capable of (and what not). A very good resource is the *Git Book*, which can
    be downloaded from [https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2),
    while printed copies are also available. [Chapter 2](ch02.html "Chapter 2. Basic

    3](ch03.html "Chapter 3. Advanced Image Processing with ImageJ"), *Advanced Image
    Processing with ImageJ* give a clear overview of how to use Git in daily life.
    It mostly uses the command-line interface for the examples. However, the graphical
    frontends that are available use the same terminology. Packt Publishing has practical
    books for working with Git as well, including *Git Version Control cookbook* and
    *Git: Version Control for Everyone*, which contain practical examples and use

    is available at [http://svnbook.red-bean.com/en/1.7/index.html](http://svnbook.red-bean.com/en/1.7/index.html).
    It details the basis of subversion and explains the process of committing changes
    and the revision process. This resource also assumes a mostly command-line approach
    to dealing with the repository system, but the terminology is similar to most
    graphical frontends. Most clients that are compatible with Git also support Subversion,
    and there are packages available that can convert a Subversion repository into
    a Git repository without (too much) loss of the structure of the repository. One
    graphical frontend that I use on a regular basis is SmartGit/Hg by Syntevo. It
    runs on all platforms and has support for GitHub repositories. It is free for
    non-commercial work, but requires a license when used for commercial projects.
