<p class="mce-root">Vaadin Framework is an open source Java web framework released under the Apache License. The framework is well documented, includes sophisticated UI components and themes, has been battle-tested in real-life applications, and is supported by a committed company and a vibrant community that contributes to the framework through forum answers and hundreds of add-ons.</p>
<p class="mce-root">Vaadin Framework allows developers to implement web user interfaces using Java code that runs on the server's JVM. The UI is rendered as HTML5 on the browser. The framework provides fully automated communication between the browser and the server through a programming model close to Swing or AWT. This allows developers/programmers bringing the benefits of object-oriented techniques to the presentation layer in web applications.</p>
<p><em>Data-Centric Applications with Vaadin</em> 8 is a practical guide that teaches you how to implement some of the most typical requirements in web applications where data management is central. You will learn about internationalization, authentication, authorization, database connectivity, CRUD views, report generation, and lazy loading of data.</p>
<p>This book will also help you to exercise your programming and software design skills by showing you how to make good decisions both at the UX and code level. You will learn how to modularize your application and how to provide APIs on top of your UI components to increase reusability and maintainability.</p>

                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>There are a number of text conventions used throughout this book.</p>
<p><kbd>CodeInText</kbd>: <span>Indicates c</span>ode words in text, database table names, folder names, filenames, file extensions, pathnames, dummy URLs, user input, and Twitter handles. <span>Here is an example:</span> "<span>The application should be available at </span><kbd>http://localhost:8080</kbd><span>.</span>"</p>
<p>A block of code is set as follows:</p>
<pre>LoginForm loginForm = new LoginForm()
loginForm.addLoginListener(e -&gt;  {
    String password = e.getLoginParameter("password");
    String username = e.getLoginParameter("username");
    ...
});</pre>
<p>When we wish to draw your attention to a particular part of a code block, the relevant lines or items are set in bold:</p>
<pre>LoginForm loginForm = new LoginForm() {
    @Override
    protected Component <strong>createContent</strong>(TextField username,
            PasswordField password, Button loginButton) {

        CheckBox rememberMe = new CheckBox();
        rememberMe.setCaption("Remember me");

        <strong>return new VerticalLayout(username, password, loginButton,
                rememberMe)</strong>;
    }
};</pre>
<p>Any command-line input or output is written as follows:</p>
<pre><strong>cd Data-centric-Applications-with-Vaadin-8</strong><br/><strong>mvn install</strong></pre>
<p><strong>Bold</strong>: Indicates a new term, an important word, or w<span>ords that you see onscreen. For example, words in menus or dialog boxes appear in the text like this. Here is an example: "Select <span class="packt_screen">System info</span> from the <span class="packt_screen">Administration</span> panel.</span><span>"</span></p>
<div class="packt_infobox">Warnings or important notes appear like this.</div>
<div class="packt_tip">Tips and tricks appear like this.</div>
