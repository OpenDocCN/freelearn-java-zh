- en: This book is aimed at developers who are at the beginner or early-intermediate
    stage of their career and want to be able to easily create robust web applications
    or RESTful services using the Java platform. You should have at least basic Java
    knowledge and know how to compile an application with a given POM file with Maven.
    It is assumed that you are at the beginner or early intermediate stage. You don't
    need to be an HTML expert but should know how HTML works and how to keep a file
    XML/XHTML compliant.

    RESTful services with Java. You will also learn a lot about the Spring Framework
    itself, which will enable you to create complete applications on your own afterward.
