- en: RabbitMQ is a message broker, providing a communication structure between components
    and services. Thanks to the **Advanced Message Queuing Protocol** (**AMQP**) and
    all available RabbitMQ client libraries, most major programming languages and
    services are able to work together seamlessly, in an asynchronous manner.

- en: If you are a professional enterprise developer or someone who just codes for
    fun, *RabbitMQ Essentials* is a valuable resource on open source message queue
    architecture. Even those who are already familiar with microservices and messaging
    will discover value in reading this book for an exploration of moving forward
    with best practices and resource efficiency. This book will give you the push
    you need to get started with creating new and exciting applications or migrating
    existing monoliths to a microservice architecture.

- en: '[Chapter 1](4f4722d3-131f-4c38-9ea0-4c03e8545175.xhtml), *A Rabbit Springs
    to Life*, is an introduction to RabbitMQ, how to get started, and the benefits
    of message queues. The chapter then instructs you on how to install and configure
    RabbitMQ and the preparation for going forward with developing applications.'

    discusses the creation of a simple taxi order application using RabbitMQ. By the
    end of this chapter, expect to have an understanding of how to connect to RabbitMQ,
    publishing with direct and topic exchanges, and consuming messages from queues.
    The chapter also explains message acknowledgments and negative acknowledgments
    (acks and nacks).'

    to Multiple Taxi Drivers*, moves on with the CC project, providing information
    on the prefetch value settings, which control the number of messages that are
    being sent to the consumer at the same time. This chapter also covers how consumers
    can manually acknowledge messages, recommendations for developing a zero-message
    loss design, and how to receive messages without acknowledgments. The chapter
    closes by providing you with a good understanding of the fanout exchange.'

    of a RabbitMQ broker. Topics include clustering, quorum queues, and federation.
    This chapter also covers a very important aspect of RabbitMQ – log processing

    or Python. All the code examples in Ruby have been tested using Ruby 2.7, and
    all the code examples in Python have been tested using Python 2.7, on macOS. However,
    they should probably work with future version releases too.
