It is built on solid foundations of the modular architecture introduced with JBoss AS 7, but it has grown in terms of flexibility and performance. The newest version of the Enterprise Java focuses on developers' productivity, and so does WildFly.</p><p class="calibre8">This book will introduce Java developers to the world of enterprise applications. We will use modern development techniques and tools that are battle-tested in real-life projects. We'll also utilize the features provided by the WildFly platform, such as security, caching, testing, and clustering. Finally, you will learn how to manage your server using dedicated tools, created specifically for WildFly.</p><p class="calibre8">The learning process will be concentrated around a ticket booking application, which is a sample project that will get more features (and sometimes completely different user interfaces) with every chapter.</p><div class="book" title="What this book covers"><div class="book"><div class="book"><div class="book"><div class="calibre13" id="calibre_pb_1"/>

To fully benefit from this book, you will need access to an Internet connection in order to download all the required tools and libraries. Knowledge of Java is required. We will also use Maven as a build automation tool, but thanks to its verbosity, the examples provided in this book are self-explanatory.</p><p class="calibre8">Although we will use AngularJS, additional JS knowledge is not required. All examples for the framework will be showcase-based, and their aim is to show how different parties can interact with Java EE in typical scenarios.</p></div>
