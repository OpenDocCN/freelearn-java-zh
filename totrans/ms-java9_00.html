<p><span>Java 9 and its new features add to the richness of the language--one of the most-used languages to build robust software applications. Java 9 comes with a special emphasis on modularity, implemented from Project Jigsaw. This book is your one-stop guide to mastering the changes made to the Java platform.</span><br/>
<br/>
<span>The book gives an overview and explanation of the new features introduced in Java 9 and the importance of the new APIs and enhancements. Some of the new features of Java 9 are groundbreaking, and if you are an experienced programmer, you will be able to make your enterprise application leaner by implementing these new features. You will be provided with practical guidance in applying the newly acquired knowledge in regards to Java 9 and further information on future developments of the Java platform. This book will improve your productivity, making your applications faster. By learning the best practices in Java, you will become the <em>go-to</em> person in your organization for Java 9.</span><br/>
<br/>
<span>By the end of this book, you will not only know the important concepts of Java 9 but you will also have a nuanced understanding of the important aspects of programming with this great language.</span></p>
