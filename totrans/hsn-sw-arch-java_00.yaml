    dismissed and replaced by other languages. But the reality is, Java is here to
    stay.

    it solves common issues in the software development world so well.'

- en: Java technology is the main topic of this book. However, in each of the chapters,
    we will have the opportunity to talk about many different ideas, and I think that
    most of them go beyond the Java programming language and are likely to be useful
    in other situations too.

- en: Indeed, in this book, I've tried to distill concepts around many aspects of
    software development, particularly development in the enterprise world, in big
    and complex businesses and projects. The goal is to give you insights by focusing
    on the most important topics. Of course, given the breadth and complexity of the
    topics, it would be impossible to take a deep dive into every aspect. But you
    will be provided with some good starting points, and you can easily find more
    resources if you want further details.

- en: Following more or less the timeline of a typical software project, we will start
    with the fundamentals of software architecture, from requirement gathering to
    modeling architecture basics. We will also look at the most common development
    models, including, of course, DevOps.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In the second section of the book, we will explore some common software architecture
    patterns. This will include Java architecture patterns, as well as middlewares
    (both for traditional and cloud-native approaches) and other essential parts of
    software architecture, such as integration, user interfaces, and data stores.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In the third and final section of the book, we will cover some additional topics,
    including cross-cutting concerns (such as security, monitoring, and tracing) as
    well as some considerations around software life cycle management. Finally, we
    will have a quick look at the latest version of the Java technology.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This book is for Java software engineers who want to become software architects
    and learn the basic concepts that a modern software architect needs to know. The
    book is also for software architects, technical leaders, engineering managers,
    vice presidents of software engineering, and CTOs looking to extend their knowledge
    and stay up to date with the latest developments in the field of software architecture.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    the Java language and the basic concepts of software development, you will still
    benefit from this book's recap of the different architecture-related topics.
