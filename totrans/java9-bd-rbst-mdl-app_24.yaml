- en: In the last chapter, we built Sunago, a social media aggregation application.
    In that chapter, we learned that Sunago is a JavaFX-based application that can
    pull posts, tweets, photos, and so on from a variety of social media networks
    and display them in one place. The application certainly provided a number of
    interesting architectural and technical examples, but the application itself could
    be more practical--we tend to interact with social networks from mobile devices
    such as phones and tablets, so a mobile version would be much more useful. In
    this chapter, then, we'll write an Android port, reusing as much of the code as
    possible.

    When building an Android application of any size, you are going to have a lot
    of layouts, menus, activities, and so on. I have found it helpful to name these
    artifacts as you see here--the layout for an `Activity` is named `activity_` plus
    the `Activity` name; menus are `menu_` plus the activity name, or, for shared
    menus, a meaningful summary of its contents. Each artifact type is prefixed by
    its type. This general pattern will help you quickly navigate to the source file
    as the number of files grows, as the arrangement of these files is very flat and

    user interface or behavior that can be placed in an Activity*. It is, effectively,
    a way for you, as the developer, to decompose the user interface definition into
    multiple pieces (or Fragments, thus, the name) that can be composed into a whole
    in an Activity in different ways depending on the current context of the application.
    For example, a Fragment-based user interface might have two screens for certain
    operations on a phone, but might combine those into one Activity for the larger
    screen on a tablet. It's a bit more complicated than that, of course, but I include
    that brief and incomplete description simply to give some explanation of the checkbox.

    It''s very basic, but it has most of what you need to create an `Activity`. Note
    that the class extends `AppCompatActivity`. While Google has been very active
    in pushing the Android platform, they have also worked tirelessly to make sure
    that older devices aren''t left behind any sooner than they have to be. To achieve
    that, Google has backported many new features in "compat" (or compatibility) packages,
    which means many of the newer APIs will actually run on older versions of Android.
    The changes, though, since they are in separate packages, won''t break any existing
    functionality--they must be explicitly opted for, which is what we''re doing here.
    While we''re not planning on supporting older versions of Android, such as KitKat,
    it is still suggested that your `Activity` classes extend the compatibility classes,
    like this one, as there is a significant number of features built in to these
    classes that we would otherwise have to implement ourselves. Let''s walk through
    this class to get a sense of what all is going on in the following steps:'
  id: totrans-49
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 这段最后的代码是 Android Studio 生成的类的确切代码。它非常基础，但它包含了创建 `Activity` 所需的大部分内容。请注意，这个类扩展了
    `AppCompatActivity`。虽然 Google 一直在积极推动 Android 平台，但他们也一直在不懈努力，确保旧设备不会比必要的时间更早被遗弃。为了实现这一点，Google
    已经在 "compat"（或兼容性）包中回滚了许多新特性，这意味着许多新的 API 实际上可以在旧版本的 Android 上运行。然而，由于它们在单独的包中，这些更改不会破坏任何现有功能——它们必须被明确选择，这正是我们在做的事情。虽然我们并不打算支持旧版本的
    Android，如 KitKat，但仍然建议你的 `Activity` 类扩展兼容性类，就像这个例子一样，因为这些类中内置了许多我们否则必须自己实现的功能。让我们按以下步骤逐步分析这个类，以了解其中发生了什么：
- en: The first method is `onCreate()`, which is an `Activity` life cycle method (we'll
    talk more about Activity life cycle in a moment). When the system creates the
    `Activity` class, this method is called. It is here that we initialize the user
    interface, setting values, connection controls to data sources, and so on. Note
    that the method takes a **Bundle**. This is how Android passes in the Activity
    state so that it may be restored.
  id: totrans-50
  prefs:
  - PREF_OL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 第一种方法是 `onCreate()`，这是一个 `Activity` 生命周期方法（我们稍后会详细讨论 `Activity` 生命周期）。当系统创建
    `Activity` 类时，这个方法会被调用。正是在这里，我们初始化用户界面，设置值，连接到数据源等等。请注意，这个方法接受一个 **Bundle**。这就是
    Android 传递 Activity 状态以便恢复的方式。
- en: In the `setContentView(R.layout.activity_main)` method, we tell the system what
    layout we want to use for this `Activity`. Once we've set the content `View` for
    `Activity`, we can then start acquiring references to various elements. Notice
    that we first look for the `Toolbar` defined in the view, `findViewById(R.id.toolbar)`,
    then we tell Android to use that as our action bar via `setSupportActionBar()`.
    This is an example of a functionality that is implemented for us via the `compat`
    class. If we extended, say, `Activity` directly, we would be required to do much
    more work to make the action bar work. As it is, we call one setter and we're
    done.
  id: totrans-51
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 在 `setContentView(R.layout.activity_main)` 方法中，我们告诉系统我们想要为这个 `Activity` 使用哪个布局。一旦我们为
    `Activity` 设置了内容 `View`，我们就可以开始获取各种元素的引用。注意，我们首先在视图中寻找定义的 `Toolbar`，使用 `findViewById(R.id.toolbar)`，然后通过
    `setSupportActionBar()` 告诉 Android 使用它作为我们的操作栏。这是一个通过 `compat` 类为我们实现的功能的例子。如果我们直接扩展了
    `Activity`，那么我们需要做更多的工作来使操作栏工作。实际上，我们只需调用一个设置器，就完成了。
- en: Next, we look up another user interface element, the `FloatingActionButton`.
    In the preceding screenshot, this is the button in the lower-right corner with
    the email icon. We will actually be removing this, but, since Android Studio generated
    it, we can learn what we can from it before it is removed. Once we have a reference
    to it, we can attach listeners. In this case, we're adding an `on Click` listener
    by creating an anonymous inner class of type `View.OnClickListener`. This works,
    but we've just spent the last five chapters getting rid of those.

    the view definition from the layout.

    the system passes in. This method is called only once, though, so if you need

    super-powered `FrameLayout`. One of its intended purposes is as *a top-level application
    decor or chrome layout*, which is exactly what we're using it for here. Layouts
    such as `CoordinatorLayout` are roughly analogous to JavaFX's containers. Different
    layouts (or `ViewGroup`) provide a variety of capabilities such as laying out
    elements with exact X/Y coordinates (`AbsoluteLayout`), in a grid (`GridLayout`),
    relative to each other (`RelativeLayout`), and so on.

    of required XML namespaces. It also sets the height and width for the control.
    There are three possible values for this field--`match_parent` (in earlier versions
    of the SDK, this was called `fill_parent` should you ever come across that), which
    means that the control should match the value of its parent, `wrap_content`, which
    means the control should be just big enough for its contents; or an exact number.

    consistent look and feel across Android apps. Its usage is encouraged by Google,
    and fortunately, the new `Activity` wizard has set us up to use it out of the
    box. The layout's width is set to `match_parent` so that it fills the screen,
    and the width is set to `wrap_content` so that's it's just big enough to show
    its content, which is a single `Toolbar`.

    If we find one connected network, we return true, otherwise, we return false.
    In the calling code, if our return value is `false`, we show an error dialog,
    the method for which is shown here as well. This is a standard Android dialog.
    We have, however, added an `onClick` listener to the OK button, which closes the

    to a central repository of data*, and that it offers a consistent, *standard interface
    to data that also handles inter-process communication and secure data access*.
    If you intend to expose your application's data to external sources (either for
    read or write), `ContentProvider` is a great way to go. However, if you don't
    intend to expose your data, you are more than welcome to write the needed CRUD
    methods yourself, manually issuing various SQL statements. In our case, we'll

    class' visibility to `GONE`, which hides it from the user interface. You might

    earlier. Each service binding will need a `ServiceConnection` object. For that,
    we created `PluginServiceConnection`, which implements the interface. Its methods
    are empty, so we'll not look at that class here. With our `ServiceConnection`
    instance, we can now bind the service with a call to `bindService()`.

- en: The interesting part, however, is the method `sendMessage()`. We start by creating
    an `Intent` that specifies our action, `sunago.service`. This is an arbitrary
    string that we define, and then document for any third-party consumers. This will
    help our services filter out messages that are of no interest, which is exactly
    what we did in `TwitterService.onBind()` with the call to `registerReceiver(receiver,
    new IntentFilter("sunago.service"))`. We then add the message that our app wants
    to send (`REFRESH`, in this case) as an extra on `Intent`, which we then broadcast
    via `sendBroadcast()`. From here, Android will handle delivering the message to
    our service, which is already running (since we've bound it to our `Activity`)
    and listening (as we registered a `BroadcastReceiver`).

    such as the implementation for `TwitterClient`, as well as any details on the
    integration of networks, such as Instagram, which we saw in the last chapter.
    For the most part, `TwitterClient` is identical to what we saw in [Chapter 21](d1cb41cc-d5b4-4f0d-a4ac-c41889568a76.xhtml),
    *Sunago - A Social Media Aggregator*. The only major difference is in the use
    of the stream APIs. Some APIs are only available in certain Android versions,
    specifically, version 24, also known as Nougat. Since we're targeting Lollipop
    (SDK version 21), we are unable to use them. That aside, the internal logic and
    API usage are identical. You can see the details in the source repository. Before
    we finish, though, we need to take a look at the Twitter preferences screen, as
    there are some interesting items there.

    `ViewPager`. The `ViewPager` is a user-interface element that actually shows the
    tabs. Think of it as `ListView` for tabs. The `FragmentPagerAdapter`, then, is
    like `CursorAdapter` for the tabs. Instead of an SQL-backed data source, though,
    `FragmentPagerAdapter` is an adapter that represents pages as Fragments. In this
    method, we create an instance of our `SectionsPagerAdapter`, and set it as the
    adapter on our `ViewPager`. We also associate the `ViewPager` element with the
    `TabLayout`.

    for each tab that is returned by `getPageTitle()`, and the `Fragment` representing
    the selected tab is returned from `getItem()`. In this example, we create a `Fragment`
    instance as needed. Note, we hint at Instagram support here, but its implementation
    looks strikingly similar to the Twitter implementation, so we won't go into detail
    on that here.

    we're updating the user interface, we have to make sure this code runs on the
    user interface thread. To make that happen, we wrap our logic in a `Runnable`,
    and pass that to the method `runOnUiThread()`. In `Runnable`, we check to see
    if the user is logged in or not. If not, we set the `prefsLayout` section's visibility
    to `GONE`, set the `Button`'s text to Login, and set its `onClick` listener to
    a `View.OnClickListener` method that executes `TwitterAuthenticateTask`.

    `updateUI()` to make sure the interface is updated to reflect the logout.

    and the result code is `Activity.RESULT_OK` (see `WebLoginActivity` given next),

    the `AccessToken`, we use that to authenticate our `TwitterClient` instance, then
    we return the token. In `onPostExecute()`, we save the `AccessToken` details to
    `SharedPreferences`. Technically, all of this could have been done in `doInBackground()`,
    but I find it helpful, especially when learning something new, not to cut corners.

    network activity begins. We can examine the desired URL to see if the query parameter
    of interest is present. If it is, we create a new `Intent` to pass data back to
    the caller, copy all of the query parameters to it, set the `Activity` result
    to `RESULT_OK`, and finish the `Activity`. If you look back at `onActivityResult()`,
    you should see now from where `resultCode` comes.
