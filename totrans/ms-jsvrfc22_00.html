<html><head></head><body><div class="preface" title="Preface"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="pref05"/>Preface</h1></div></div></div><p>This book will cover all the important aspects (Big Ticket features) involved in developing JSF 2.2 applications. It provides clear instructions for getting the most out of JSF 2.2 and offers many exercises (more than 300 complete applications) to build impressive JSF-based web applications.</p><p>We start off with a chapter about Expression Language (EL) and cover the most important aspects of EL 2.2 and EL 3.0. We continue with a comprehensive dissertation about communication in JSF, followed by an exciting chapter about JSF 2.2 scopes. At this point, we bring into discussion most of the JSF artifacts and configurations. Further, we start a suite of very interesting topics, such as HTML5 and AJAX. After that we dissect the JSF view state concept and learn how to deal with this delicate JSF topic. Furthermore, we will discuss in detail about custom components and composite components. After this, we will talk about library contracts (themes) of JSF 2.2 resources. Finally, the last chapter will fortify your knowledge about JSF 2.2 Facelets.</p><div class="section" title="What this book covers"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl1sec02"/>What this book covers</h1></div></div></div><p><a class="link" href="ch01.html" title="Chapter 1. Dynamic Access to JSF Application Data through Expression Language (EL 3.0)">Chapter 1</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Dynamic Access to JSF Application Data through Expression Language (EL 3.0)</em></span>, covers the main aspects of Expression Language (EL). We will cover EL 2.2 and EL 3.0, including new operators, lambda expressions, and collection object support.</p><p><a class="link" href="ch02.html" title="Chapter 2. Communication in JSF">Chapter 2</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Communication in JSF</em></span>, represents a dissection of JSF mechanisms used for ensuring communication between JSF artifacts. Therefore, we will cover context parameters, request parameters, JSF 2.2 actions on GET requests (view actions), and more.</p><p><a class="link" href="ch03.html" title="Chapter 3. JSF Scopes – Lifespan and Use in Managed Beans Communication">Chapter 3</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>JSF Scopes – Lifespan and Use in Managed Beans Communication</em></span>, teaches you to distinguish between the bad and good practices of using JSF and CDI scopes. We will discuss JSF scopes versus CDI scopes, request, session, view scope (including the new JSF 2.2 view scope), application, conversation scope, JSF 2.2 flow scope in detail (Big Ticket feature), and more.</p><p><a class="link" href="ch04.html" title="Chapter 4. JSF Configurations Using XML Files and Annotations – Part 1">Chapter 4</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>JSF Configurations Using XML Files and Annotations – Part 1</em></span>, depicts the JSF artifact's configuration aspects in a learning-by-example fashion. Configuring JSF artifacts in the <code class="literal">faces-config.xml</code> file is pretty straightforward and boring, but if we take each artifact and exploit its potential in several use cases, then things become much more interesting.</p><p><a class="link" href="ch05.html" title="Chapter 5. JSF Configurations Using XML Files and Annotations – Part 2">Chapter 5</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>JSF Configurations Using XML Files and Annotations – Part 2</em></span>, acts as a continuation of the previous chapter. Here, we will discuss configuring resource handlers (JSF 2.2's new <code class="literal">javax.faces.WEBAPP_RESOURCES_DIRECTORY</code> context parameter), configuring flash (JSF 2.2 <code class="literal">FlashFactory</code>, <code class="literal">FlashWrapper</code>, and flash system events), JSF 2.2 Window ID API, the injection mechanism (which, starting with JSF 2.2, is possible in most JSF artifacts), and more.</p><p><a class="link" href="ch06.html" title="Chapter 6. Working with Tabular Data">Chapter 6</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Working with Tabular Data</em></span>, pays tribute to the <code class="literal">&lt;h:dataTable&gt;</code> tag. Here, we will focus on the JSF 2.2 <code class="literal">CollectionDataModel</code> API (which supports the <code class="literal">Collection</code> interface in <code class="literal">UIData</code>). Moreover, we will learn about table pagination, deleting/editing/updating table rows, filtering, and styling JSF tables.</p><p><a class="link" href="ch07.html" title="Chapter 7. JSF and AJAX">Chapter 7</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>JSF and AJAX</em></span>, exploits the JSF 2.2 <code class="literal">delay</code> attribute for queue control of AJAX requests. It discusses how to reset value attributes using JSF 2.2 (input fields can be updated with AJAX after a validation error), AJAX and JSF 2.2 flow scope, how to customize AJAX script, and more. This is a classic chapter in almost any JSF book.</p><p><a class="link" href="ch08.html" title="Chapter 8. JSF 2.2 – HTML5 and Upload">Chapter 8</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>JSF 2.2 – HTML5 and Upload</em></span>, divides the topic into two parts. The first part is entirely dedicated to the Big Ticket feature, HTML5, and JSF 2.2 (pass-through attributes and elements). The second part is dedicated to JSF 2.2's new upload component, <code class="literal">&lt;h:inputFile&gt;</code>.</p><p><a class="link" href="ch09.html" title="Chapter 9. JSF State Management">Chapter 9</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>JSF State Management</em></span>, provides a detailed dissertation about the JSF view state. The headings of this chapter will refer to JSF's saving view state (including JSF 2.2 case insensitivity for state saving method and standardized server state serialization) and JSF 2.2 stateless view (Big Ticket feature).</p><p><a class="link" href="ch10.html" title="Chapter 10. JSF Custom Components">Chapter 10</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>JSF Custom Components</em></span>, is another example of a classic chapter in any JSF book. Obviously, the main topics are meant to shape the custom and composite components creation. We will focus on developing several kinds of components based on the new JSF 2.2 approach (Facelet's component tag can be declared via annotation).</p><p><a class="link" href="ch11.html" title="Chapter 11. JSF 2.2 Resource Library Contracts – Themes">Chapter 11</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>JSF 2.2 Resource Library Contracts – Themes</em></span>, dedicates itself to the new JSF 2.2 Resource Library Contracts feature (Big Ticket feature). You will learn how to work with contracts, style JSF tables and UI components using contracts, style contracts across different kind of devices, and more.</p><p><a class="link" href="ch12.html" title="Chapter 12. Facelets Templating">Chapter 12</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Facelets Templating</em></span>, depicts the viral aspects of Facelets templating. We will focus on the declarative and programmatical aspects of Facelets.</p><p><a class="link" href="apa.html" title="Appendix A. The JSF Life Cycle">Appendix</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>The JSF Life Cycle</em></span>, covers a diagram of the different JSF phases.</p></div></div>
