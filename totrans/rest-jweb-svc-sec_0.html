Today, we can say that no company is able to work in complete isolation, without the need to interact with others and share and consume information. Furthermore, this is the most important asset of any company. For this reason, these requirements are also common between lines of code. This book presents real scenarios with applicable solutions, leading you by the hand all the way, so you can easily learn solutions and implementations that will resolve the most common needs that can arise.</p><p>RESTful web services<span class="emphasis"><em> </em></span>offer several advantages over those based on SOAP. For example, when handling data types, depending on the programming language or the libraries you use to create them, you can find inconsistencies when using empty values ("") instead of NULL. Also, you may find difficulties in mapping complex objects and compatibility issues in file transferring when using different versions of libraries to create/consume the web service. In certain situations, even when consuming a web service created in Java from a .NET application, it ends up creating a service implemented in Java in the middle of both. This does not occur in RESTful web services, since in this case, the functionality is exposed through HTTP method invocations.</p><p>In order to protect information, the world of securities has many features that help to achieve this. For example, understanding how some issues such as authentication and authorization assist in the implementation of any selected mechanism, where the main objective is to make our applications safer and secure, is essential. The selection of each of the different ways to secure applications goes along with the problem you want to resolve; for this, we show usage scenarios for each of them.</p><p>Many times, we have seen large organizations spend time and effort in creating their own implementations to handle securities rather than using the standard that has already resolved what we need. Through the knowledge that we want to share with you, we hope to avoid this process of reinventing the wheel.</p><div class="section" title="What this book covers"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl1sec02"/>What this book covers</h1></div></div></div><p>
<a class="link" href="ch01.html" title="Chapter 1. Setting Up the Environment">Chapter 1</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Setting Up the Environment</em></span>, helps us create our first functional application, something very similar to a <span class="emphasis"><em>Hello World</em></span> example, but with some more functionality and very close to the real world. The main aim of this chapter is to familiarize ourselves with the tools we are going to use.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch02.html" title="Chapter 2. The Importance of Securing Web Services">Chapter 2</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>The Importance of Securing Web Services</em></span>, goes through all possible models of authentication in the Java platform. For your better understanding, we will go step by step and dive deep into how we can leverage each available authentication model. We will show you how the information is exposed and how it can be intercepted by third parties, and we will play with Wireshark, which is a very good tool to explain it.</p><p>Finally, in this chapter, we will review the differences between authentication and authorization. Both concepts are very important and definitely impossible to put aside in the context of securities terms.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch03.html" title="Chapter 3. Security Management with RESTEasy">Chapter 3</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Security Management with RESTEasy</em></span>, shows how RESTEasy offers mechanisms to handle security, starting from a fairly basic model (coarse-grained) to a more elaborate one (fine-grained) in which you can perform more exhaustive controls, including managing not only configuration files, but also programmatical files.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch04.html" title="Chapter 4. RESTEasy Skeleton Key">Chapter 4</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>RESTEasy Skeleton Key</em></span>, helps us study the OAuth implementation along with the token bearer implementation and Single Sign-On. All of them are used in order to limit the way the resources are shared. As always, you will get hands-on with code and real examples. We want to show you how sharing resources and information between applications through these technologies has turned into one of the most useful and powerful techniques by allowing clients or users to use their credentials only once to access several services, limiting the access to third-party applications to your information or data, and implementing access control through the token bearer. You will learn to apply these technologies and concepts in order to build secure and flexible applications.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch05.html" title="Chapter 5. Digital Signatures and Encryption of Messages">Chapter 5</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Digital Signatures and Encryption of Messages</em></span>, helps us understand the benefits of digital signatures using a simple example; you'll notice how the message's receiver can validate the identity of the sender. In addition, we will simulate when an external agent modifies data in transit and see how digital signatures can help us to detect it, in order to avoid working with corrupted data.</p><p>Finally, we will explain SMIME for body encryption and how it works, with an example that encrypts requests and responses for your better understanding.</p></div></div>

<div class="section" title="Who this book is for"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl1sec04"/>Who this book is for</h1></div></div></div><p>This book is intended for developers, software analysts, architects, or people who work with software development and RESTful web services. This book requires some previous knowledge of object-oriented programming concepts in Java or any other language.</p><p>No previous knowledge on security models is required because we explain the theory and apply it on practical examples in this book.</p></div>
<div class="section" title="Conventions"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl1sec05"/>Conventions</h1></div></div></div><p>In this book, you will find a number of styles of text that distinguish between different kinds of information. Here are some examples of these styles, and an explanation of their meaning.</p><p>Code words in text, database table names, folder names, filenames, file extensions, pathnames, dummy URLs, user input, and Twitter handles are shown as follows: "We are going to modify the <code class="literal">web.xml</code> file."</p><p>A block of code is set as follows:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">private boolean isUserAllowed(final String username, final String password, final Set&lt;String&gt; rolesSet) {
    boolean isAllowed = false;
    if (rolesSet.contains(ADMIN)) {
      isAllowed = true;
    }
    return isAllowed;
  }
}</pre></div><p>When we wish to draw your attention to a particular part of a code block, the relevant lines or items are set in bold:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">final List&lt;String&gt; authorizationList = <span class="strong"><strong>headersMap.get(AUTHORIZATION_PROPERTY);</strong></span>
</pre></div><p>Any command-line input or output is written as follows:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">
<span class="strong"><strong>mvn clean install</strong></span>
</pre></div><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>New terms </strong></span>and <span class="strong"><strong>important</strong></span> words are shown in bold. Words that you see on the screen, in menus or dialog boxes for example, appear in the text like this: "From the pop-up window, select the <span class="strong"><strong>SSL Settings</strong></span> tab."</p><div class="note" style="" title="Note"><div class="inner"><h3 class="title"><a id="note01"/>Note</h3><p>Warnings or important notes appear in a box like this.</p></div></div><div class="note" style="" title="Note"><div class="inner"><h3 class="title"><a id="tip01"/>Tip</h3><p>Tips and tricks appear like this.</p></div></div></div>
