<p>Despite its age, Java still remains one of the most popular choices among developers, having made it through almost 20 years of constant improvements and having developed a full stack of libraries for enterprise systems. As we are living in a fast-paced industry, we cannot deny that many things have changed in the last few years with the introduction of containers, microservices, reactive applications, and cloud platforms. To remain a first-class citizen in this changing world, Java needs a boost. And we, at Red Hat, believe that this boost can be Quarkus!</p>
<p>Quarkus has been designed from the ground up to be a Kubernetes-native Java framework that is a perfect fit for creating microservice applications with a minimal memory footprint and fast execution. At the same time, Quarkus does not dump the rich set of libraries, such as Hibernate, and REST services that most developers are familiar with. On the contrary, they are part of a larger picture that includes the game-changing MicroProfile API, reactive programming models such as Vert.x, and a ton of other features that can be easily plugged into your services.</p>
<p class="mce-root"><span>Quarkus provides an effective solution for running Java in this new world of serverless, microservices, containers, Kubernetes, <strong>Function as a Service</strong> (<strong>FaaS</strong>), and the cloud because it has been designed with these in mind. Its container-first approach to cloud-native Java applications unifies imperative and reactive programming paradigms for microservices development and offers an extensible set of standards-based enterprise Java libraries and frameworks combined with extreme developer productivity that promises to revolutionize the way we develop in Java.</span><br/></p>

<p><a href="0e04a6a1-5a50-4557-be00-f4a3406fa1dd.xhtml">Chapter 1</a>, <span><em>Introduction to Quarkus Core Concepts</em>, </span><span>explains the container-first (minimal-footprint Java applications are optimal for running in containers), cloud-native (Quarkus embraces the 12-factor architecture of environments such as Kubernetes), and microservice-first (Quarkus brings lightning-fast start up times and code turnaround times to Java apps) approaches. We will examine the various tools available for developing Quarkus applications. For this, we will install an IDE and GraalVM, which is required for native applications.</span></p>
<p><a href="ab522c0c-82d4-4c52-979f-1dccee6c5df5.xhtml">Chapter 2</a>, <span><em>Developing Your First Application with Quarkus</em>, t</span><span>akes you through building your first application with Quarkus. We will see how to use Maven/Gradle plugins to bootstrap your application. You will learn how to import the application in your IDS, and how to run and test the application. Next, we will discuss creating a native application from your Java project.</span></p>
<p><a href="f071b470-1934-4c83-9af2-e363b74af839.xhtml">Chapter 3</a>, <span><em>Creating a Container Image of Your Application</em>, </span><span>looks at how to build a Docker image of your application, how to run an application on Docker, how to install a single-node cluster of OpenShift, and how to run an application on Minishift.</span></p>
<p><a href="1eb0a987-ab8b-40a1-ab16-6562b8a45344.xhtml">Chapter 4</a>, <span><em>Web Application Development</em>, </span><span>looks at the use case of a customer store application that will use REST and the CDI stack and a web frontend. We will see how to deploy the application and see changes without restarting Quarkus.</span></p>
<p><a href="078ed3f6-b849-4240-a0d4-cf3bd58c00ab.xhtml">Chapter 5</a>, <span><em>Managing Data Persistence with Quarkus</em>,</span> <span>discusses data persistence with Quarkus. We will see how to add persistence to the customer store example as well as setting up a database (PostgreSQL) to run the example. We will then take the application to the cloud. Finally, we will show you how Hibernate Panache can simplify application development.</span></p>
<p><a href="a406d6a0-e183-468f-a213-5f71245ce753.xhtml">Chapter 6</a>, <em>Building Applications Using the MicroProfile API</em><span>, teaches you</span><span> how to complement the Enterprise API that we have already discussed with the full stack of Eclipse MicroProfile specifications (<a href="https://microprofile.io/">https://microprofile.io/</a>).</span></p>
<p><a href="9cdeac43-9347-4ef9-8bed-3b1025e20e34.xhtml">Chapter 7</a>, <span><em>Securing Applications</em>, will explore</span><span> how to secure our example application with built-in security APIs such as the Elytron Security stack, the Keycloak extension, and the MicroProfile JWT extension.</span></p>
<p><a href="710ace2a-f51a-4cba-80bc-a97a1fb5cadc.xhtml"/></p>
<p><a href="710ace2a-f51a-4cba-80bc-a97a1fb5cadc.xhtml">Chapter 8</a>, <span><em>Advanced Application Development</em>, gets into</span><span> advanced application development techniques such as advanced application configuration management, life cycle events, and firing scheduled tasks.</span></p>
<p><a href="3ca131cb-e293-4c25-a7c8-29d05a409ccd.xhtml">Chapter 9</a>, <span><em>Unifying Imperative and Reactive</em>, </span><span>takes you through the non-blocking programming model with Quarkus and an example application using the Vert.x programming model with Quarkus. We will also explore how to leverage Vert.x's reactive SQL API to build non-blocking database applications.</span></p>
<p><a href="daa878e3-36c0-47a8-8c64-725fafca0ea5.xhtml">Chapter 10</a>, <em><span>Reactive Messaging with Quarkus</span></em><span>,</span> <span>explains how to implement reactive data streaming applications using a CDI development model and Kafka and AMQP as a broker. We will also explain how to implement a full streaming architecture in the cloud by deploying our application on OpenShift.</span></p>

<p><em>Hands-On Cloud-Native Applications with Java and Quarkus</em> is a complete end-to-end development guide that will give you hands-on experience with building Kubernetes-native applications in serverless environments. To get the most out of this book, we recommend using a development environment that is integrated with Apache Maven (such as IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse) and import it into our example code files. That will help you to follow our projects step-by-step and, when needed, to debug them.</p>

            <article>
                
<p>There are a number of text conventions used throughout this book.</p>
<p><kbd>CodeInText</kbd>: <span>Indicates c</span>ode words in text, database table names, folder names, filenames, file extensions, pathnames, dummy URLs, user input, and Twitter handles. <span>Here is an example:</span> "<span>An </span><kbd>index.html</kbd><span> page is provided as a </span>marker<span> in our project, as shown in the project's hierarchy</span>."</p>
<p>A block of code is set as follows:</p>
<pre><span> </span><span>// Create new JSON for Order #1<br/></span><span>    </span>objOrder = Json.<span>createObjectBuilder</span>()<br/>            .add(<span>"id"</span><span>, new </span>Long(<span>1</span>))<br/>            .add(<span>"item"</span><span>, </span><span>"mountain bike"</span>)<br/>            .add(<span>"price"</span><span>, new </span>Long(<span>100</span>))</pre>
<p>When we wish to draw your attention to a particular part of a code block, the relevant lines or items are set in bold:</p>
<pre><span>@POST<br/></span><strong><span>@RolesAllowed</span>(<span>"admin"</span>)</strong><br/><span>public </span>Response <span>create</span>(Customer customer)</pre>
<p>Any command-line input or output is written as follows:</p>
<pre><strong>$ tree src</strong></pre>
<p><strong>Bold</strong>: Indicates a new term, an important word, or w<span>ords that you see on screen. For example, words in menus or dialog boxes appear in the text like this. Here is an example: "Once you have some data, other actions (such as <span class="packt_screen">Edit </span>and <span class="packt_screen">Delete</span>) will be available.</span><span>"</span></p>
<div class="packt_infobox">Warnings or important notes appear like this.</div>
<div class="packt_tip">Tips and tricks appear like this.</div>
