			<h1 id="_idParaDest-53"><a id="_idTextAnchor052"/>Variables and Primitive Data Types</h1>
			<p>In <a href="B19793_01.xhtml#_idTextAnchor018"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 1</em></span></a>, we introduced the compiler and the JVM. We learned how to use both of them from the command line when we wrote our first Java program, <em class="italic">HelloWorld</em>. We also introduced <strong class="bold">IntelliJ</strong>, a powerful and friendly IDE, and we ran <em class="italic">HelloWorld</em> from there <span class="No-Break">as well.</span></p>
			<p>All programming languages require variables and provide in-built primitive data types. They are essential for the operation of even the simplest programs. By the end of this chapter, you will be able to declare variables using Java’s primitive types. In addition, you will understand the differences between the various primitive data types and which ones to use in a <span class="No-Break">given situation.</span></p>
			<p>In this chapter, we are going to cover the following <span class="No-Break">main topics:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li>Understanding and <span class="No-Break">declaring variables</span></li>
				<li>Exploring Java’s primitive <span class="No-Break">data types</span></li>

			<h1 id="_idParaDest-55"><a id="_idTextAnchor054"/>Understanding and declaring variables</h1>
			<p>If you want to store a value<a id="_idIndexMarker121"/> for later use, you need a variable. Therefore, every programming language<a id="_idTextAnchor055"/> provides this feature via variables. In this section, we will learn what a variable is and how to declare one. The area in your code where <a id="_idIndexMarker122"/>you can use a particular variable is known as the variable’s <em class="italic">scope</em>. This is a very important concept and will be covered in detail in <a href="B19793_04.xhtml#_idTextAnchor087"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 4</em></span></a><span class="No-Break">.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-56"><a id="_idTextAnchor056"/>What is a variable?</h2>
			<p>Variables<a id="_idIndexMarker123"/> are locations in memory that have a <em class="italic">name</em> (called an identifier) and a <em class="italic">type</em>. They resemble named<a id="_idIndexMarker124"/> pigeonholes or post office boxes (see <span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Figure 2</em></span><em class="italic">.1</em>). The variable’s name is required so that we can refer to the variable and distinguish it from <span class="No-Break">other variables.</span></p>
			<p>A variable’s <em class="italic">type</em> specifies the sort of values it can store/hold. For example, is the variable to be used for storing whole numbers such as 4 or decimal numbers such as 2.98? The answer to that question determines the <span class="No-Break">variable’s </span><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">type</em></span><span class="No-Break">.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-57"><a id="_idTextAnchor057"/>Declaring a variable</h2>
			<p>Let’s suppose we want<a id="_idIndexMarker125"/> to store the number 25 in a variable. We will assume that this number represents a person’s age, so we will use the <strong class="source-inline">age</strong> identifier to refer to it. Introducing a variable for the first time is known as “declaring” <span class="No-Break">the variable.</span></p>
			<p>A whole number (positive or negative) is an integer and Java provides an in-built primitive type especially for integers called <strong class="source-inline">int</strong>. We will discuss primitive data types in more detail in the next section. When declaring a variable in Java, we must specify the variables type. This is because Java is known as a <em class="italic">strongly typed</em> language, which means<a id="_idIndexMarker126"/> you must <a id="_idIndexMarker127"/>specify the variable’s type immediately upon <span class="No-Break">declaring it.</span></p>
			<p>Let’s declare a variable, give it a type, and <span class="No-Break">initialize it:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
int age;age = 25;</pre>
			<p>The first line declares <strong class="source-inline">age</strong> as an <strong class="source-inline">int</strong> and the second line assigns it a value <span class="No-Break">of </span><span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">25</strong></span><span class="No-Break">.</span></p>
			<p>Note that the semi-colons (<strong class="source-inline">;</strong>) at the end of the lines are delimiters that tell the compiler where a Java statement ends. The <strong class="source-inline">=</strong> sign is the assignment operator and will be covered in <a href="B19793_03.xhtml#_idTextAnchor067"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 3</em></span></a>. For now, just realize that <strong class="source-inline">25</strong> is “assigned into” the <span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">age</strong></span><span class="No-Break"> variable.</span></p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Assignment operator</p>
			<p class="callout">The <strong class="source-inline">=</strong> sign in Java<a id="_idIndexMarker128"/> is not the same as the equals sign, =, in mathematics. Java uses the <strong class="source-inline">==</strong> sign for equals, which is <span class="No-Break">called equivalence.</span></p>
			<p>We can write the previous two lines of code in <span class="No-Break">one line:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
int age = 25;</pre>			<p><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Figure 2</em></span><em class="italic">.1</em> shows the in-memory representation of both <span class="No-Break">code segments:</span></p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer023" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B19793_02_01.jpg" alt="Figure 2.1 – An integer variable named age with a value of 25"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 2.1 – An integer variable named age with a value of 25</p>
			<p>As can be seen in <span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Figure 2</em></span><em class="italic">.1</em>, <strong class="bold">age</strong> is the name of the variable and <strong class="bold">25</strong> is the integer value stored<a id="_idIndexMarker129"/> in the <span class="No-Break">variable’s </span><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">location</em></span><span class="No-Break">.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-58"><a id="_idTextAnchor058"/>Naming a variable</h2>
			<p>An identifier<a id="_idIndexMarker130"/> is simply a name that you give to the Java construct you are coding; for example, identifiers (names) are required for naming variables, methods, classes, and <span class="No-Break">so forth.</span></p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Identifiers</p>
			<p class="callout">An identifier <a id="_idIndexMarker131"/>consists of letters, digits, underscores, and currency symbols. Identifiers cannot begin with a number and cannot contain whitespace (spaces, tabs, and newlines). In the following examples, the commas separate the <span class="No-Break">various identifiers.</span></p>
			<p class="callout">Examples of unusual but <em class="italic">valid</em> identifiers are <strong class="source-inline">a£€_23</strong>, <strong class="source-inline">_29</strong>, <strong class="source-inline">Z</strong>, <strong class="source-inline">thisIsAnExampleOfAVeryLongVariableName</strong>, <strong class="source-inline">€2_</strong>, and <strong class="source-inline">$</strong><span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">4 ;</strong></span><span class="No-Break">.</span></p>
			<p class="callout">Examples of <em class="italic">invalid</em> identifiers are <strong class="source-inline">9age</strong> and <span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">abc def;</strong></span><span class="No-Break">.</span></p>
			<p>Name your variables carefully. This helps make code more readable, which results in fewer bugs and easier maintenance. <em class="italic">Camel case</em> is a very popular technique in this regard. Concerning variable names, camel case means that <em class="italic">all</em> of the first word is lowercase. In addition, the first letter in each subsequent word in the variable name starts with an uppercase letter. Here’s <span class="No-Break">an example:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
int ageOfCar;int numberOfChildren;</pre>
			<p>In this code segment, we have<a id="_idIndexMarker132"/> two integer variables whose names/identifiers follow <span class="No-Break">camel casing.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-59"><a id="_idTextAnchor059"/>Accessing a variable</h2>
			<p>To access <a id="_idIndexMarker133"/>a variable’s value, just type in the variable’s name. When we type in a variable’s name in Java, the compiler will first ensure that a variable with that name exists. Assuming there is, the JVM will, at runtime, return the <em class="italic">value inside</em> that variable’s pigeonhole. Therefore, the following code will output <strong class="source-inline">25</strong> to <span class="No-Break">the screen:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
int age = 25;System.out.println(<strong class="bold">age</strong>);</pre>
			<p>The first line declares the <strong class="source-inline">age</strong> variable and initializes it to <strong class="source-inline">25</strong>. The second line accesses the variable’s location and outputs <span class="No-Break">its value.</span></p>
			<p class="callout-heading">System.out.println()</p>
			<p class="callout"><strong class="source-inline">System.out.println()</strong> displays whatever is inside the round brackets, <strong class="source-inline">()</strong>, on <span class="No-Break">the screen.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-60"><a id="_idTextAnchor060"/>Accessing a variable that you have not declared</h2>
			<p>As stated previously, Java is known as a <em class="italic">strongly typed</em> language. This means<a id="_idIndexMarker134"/> that you have to specify the variable’s type immediately upon declaring it. If the compiler comes across a variable and does not know its type, it generates an error. For example, consider the following line <span class="No-Break">of code:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
age = 25;</pre>			<p>Assuming no other code declares <strong class="source-inline">age</strong>, the compiler generates an error stating <strong class="source-inline">cannot resolve symbol 'age'</strong>. This is because the compiler is looking for the <em class="italic">type</em> to associate with <em class="italic">age</em> and it cannot find it (as we did not specify <span class="No-Break">the type).</span></p>
			<p>Here is a slightly different example. In this example, we are attempting to output the <strong class="source-inline">age</strong> variable to <span class="No-Break">the screen:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
        int length = 25;        System.out.println(<strong class="bold">age</strong>);</pre>
			<p>In this example, we have declared a variable named <strong class="source-inline">length</strong> and thus, there is no declaration of <strong class="source-inline">age</strong>. When we attempt to access the <strong class="source-inline">age</strong> variable in <strong class="source-inline">System.out.println()</strong>, the compiler goes looking for <strong class="source-inline">age</strong>. The compiler cannot find <strong class="source-inline">age</strong> and generates an error stating <strong class="source-inline">cannot resolve symbol 'age'</strong>. In effect, what the compiler is saying is that we have attempted to use a variable named <strong class="source-inline">age</strong> that the compiler<a id="_idIndexMarker135"/> cannot find. This is because we did not even declare the variable, not to mention specify <span class="No-Break">its type.</span></p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Comments</p>
			<p class="callout">Comments are very useful as they help us explain what is happening in <span class="No-Break">the code.</span></p>
			<p class="callout"><strong class="source-inline">//</strong> is a single-line comment. When<a id="_idIndexMarker136"/> the compiler<a id="_idIndexMarker137"/> sees <strong class="source-inline">//</strong>, it ignores the rest of <span class="No-Break">the line.</span></p>
			<p class="callout">.<strong class="source-inline">/* some text */</strong> is a multi-line comment. Anything between<a id="_idIndexMarker138"/> the opening <strong class="source-inline">/*</strong> and the closing <strong class="source-inline">*/</strong> is ignored. This format saves inserting <strong class="source-inline">//</strong> at the start of <span class="No-Break">each line.</span></p>
			<p class="callout">Here are <span class="No-Break">some examples:</span></p>
			<p class="callout"><strong class="source-inline">int age; // from here to the rest of the line </strong><span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">is ignored</strong></span></p>
			<p class="callout"><strong class="source-inline">// this whole line </strong><span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">is ignored</strong></span></p>
			<p class="callout"><strong class="source-inline">/*    </strong><span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">all</strong></span></p>
			<p class="callout"><span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">of</strong></span></p>
			<p class="callout"><span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">these lines</strong></span></p>
			<p class="callout"><span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">are</strong></span></p>
			<p class="callout"><strong class="source-inline">ignored   */</strong></p>
			<p>Given that Java, as a strongly<a id="_idIndexMarker139"/> typed language, requires all variables to have a data type, we will now discuss Java’s support for primitive <span class="No-Break">data types.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-61"><a id="_idTextAnchor061"/>Understanding Java’s primitive data types</h1>
			<p>Java provides eight in-built <a id="_idIndexMarker140"/>data types. In-built means that these data types come with the language. These primitive data types are the topic of <span class="No-Break">this section.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-62"><a id="_idTextAnchor062"/>Java’s primitive data types</h2>
			<p>All of the primitive data types are named using lowercase letters only; for example, <strong class="source-inline">int</strong> and <strong class="source-inline">double</strong>. When we create our own data types later on, namely classes, records, and interfaces, we will follow a different naming convention. For example, we may have a class named <strong class="source-inline">Person</strong> or <strong class="source-inline">Cat</strong>. This is simply a widely adopted coding convention and the compiler does not distinguish between naming conventions. However, it is very easy to recognize any of the primitive data types as they are always in lowercase letters only. Before we discuss the primitive data types themselves, there are a few important points <span class="No-Break">to make.</span></p>
			<h3>Numeric primitive data types are signed</h3>
			<p>In Java, all numeric primitive data types<a id="_idIndexMarker141"/> are represented as a series of bits. In addition, they are also signed. The most significant bit (leftmost bit) is used for the sign; 1 means negative and 0 <span class="No-Break">means positive.</span></p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Integer literals</p>
			<p class="callout">A literal value is one<a id="_idIndexMarker142"/> that’s typed in at the keyboard (as opposed to a computed value). An integer literal can be expressed in various numbering systems: decimal (base 10), hexadecimal (base 16), octal (base 8), and binary (base 2). However, it is no surprise that decimal is by far the most commonly used representation. For information purposes, all of the following declarations represent the decimal <span class="No-Break">number 10:</span></p>
			<p class="callout"><strong class="source-inline">int a = 10;     // decimal, </strong><span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">the default</strong></span></p>
			<p class="callout"><strong class="source-inline">int b = 0b1010; // binary, prefixed by 0b </strong><span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">or 0B</strong></span></p>
			<p class="callout"><strong class="source-inline">int c = 012;    // octal, prefixed </strong><span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">by 0</strong></span></p>
			<p class="callout"><strong class="source-inline">int d = 0xa;    // hexadecimal, prefixed by 0x </strong><span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">or 0X</strong></span></p>
			<h3>The sign bit affects the range</h3>
			<p>The <a id="_idIndexMarker143"/>presence of the sign bit means that <strong class="source-inline">byte</strong> has a range of -2<span class="superscript">7</span> to 2<span class="superscript">7</span>-1 (-128 to +127 inclusive). The -1 in the positive range is to allow for the fact that, in Java, 0 is considered a positive number. There is <em class="italic">not</em> one less positive number in any of the ranges. For example, with <strong class="source-inline">byte</strong>, you have 128 negative numbers (-1 to -128) and 128 positive numbers (0 to +127), resulting in 256 representations (2<span class="superscript">8</span>). To reinforce this point with a simple example, -1 to -8 is 8 numbers and 0 to 7 (inclusive) is 8 <span class="No-Break">numbers also.</span></p>
			<p>With these points discussed, let’s look at the various primitive types. <em class="italic">Table 2.1</em> lists the eight primitive data types, their byte sizes, and their ranges (all of which <span class="No-Break">are inclusive):</span></p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer024" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B19793_02_Table_01.jpg" alt="" role="presentation"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Figure">Table 2.1 – Java’s primitive types</p>
			<p>Here are some <a id="_idIndexMarker144"/>interesting points from the <span class="No-Break">preceding table:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="source-inline">byte</strong>, <strong class="source-inline">short</strong>, <strong class="source-inline">char</strong>, <strong class="source-inline">int</strong>, and <strong class="source-inline">long</strong> are known as <em class="italic">integral</em> types as they have integer<a id="_idIndexMarker145"/> values (whole numbers, positive or negative). For example, -8, 17, and 625 are all <span class="No-Break">integer numbers.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="source-inline">char</strong> is used for characters – for example ‘a’, ‘b’, ‘?’ and ‘+’. Note that single quotes surround the character. In code, <strong class="source-inline">char c = 'a';</strong> means that the variable <strong class="source-inline">c</strong> represents the letter <strong class="source-inline">a</strong>. As computers ultimately store all characters (on the keyboard) as numbers internally (binary), we need an encoding system to map the characters to numbers and vice versa. Java uses the Unicode encoding standard, which ensures a unique number for every character, regardless of platform, language, script, and so on. This is why <strong class="source-inline">char</strong> uses 2 bytes as opposed to 1. In fact, from the computer’s perspective, <strong class="source-inline">char c = 'a'</strong>; is the same as <strong class="source-inline">char c = 97;</strong> where 97 is the decimal value for ‘a’ in Unicode. Obviously, we as humans prefer the <span class="No-Break">letter representation.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="source-inline">short</strong> and <strong class="source-inline">char</strong> both require 2 bytes but have different ranges. Note that <strong class="source-inline">short</strong> can represent negative numbers, whereas <strong class="source-inline">char</strong> cannot. In contrast, <strong class="source-inline">char</strong> can store numbers such as 65,000, whereas <span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">short</strong></span><span class="No-Break"> cannot.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="source-inline">float</strong> and <strong class="source-inline">double</strong> are for <a id="_idIndexMarker146"/>floating-point numbers – in other words, numbers that have decimal places, such as 23.78 and -98.453. These floating-point numbers can use scientific notation – for example, 130000.0 can be expressed as <strong class="source-inline">double d1=1.3e+5;</strong>, and 0.13 can be expressed as <span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">double d2=1.3e-1;</strong></span><span class="No-Break">.</span></li>
			</ul>
			<h3>Representation of the various types</h3>
			<p>Expanding from the previous<a id="_idIndexMarker147"/> callout, we can express integer literals using the following <span class="No-Break">numbering systems:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="source-inline">Decimal</strong>: Base 10; numbers 0..9. This is <span class="No-Break">the default.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="source-inline">Hexadecimal</strong>: Base 16; numbers 0..9 and letters a..f (or A..F). Prefix the literal with <em class="italic">0x</em> or <em class="italic">0X</em> to indicate that this is a <span class="No-Break">hexadecimal literal.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="source-inline">binary</strong>: Base 2; numbers 0..1. Prefix the literal with <em class="italic">0b</em> or <em class="italic">0B</em> to indicate that this is a <span class="No-Break">binary literal.</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>Here are some sample code fragments that initialize <strong class="source-inline">int</strong> variables to 30 using the various numbering systems. Firstly, decimal is used; then hexadecimal, and <span class="No-Break">finally, binary:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
// decimalint dec = 30;
// hexadecimal = 16 + 14
int hex = 0x1E;
// binary = 16 + 8 + 4 + 2
int bin = 0b11110;</pre>
			<p>Although there are several ways to initialize an <strong class="source-inline">int</strong>, using decimal is by far the <span class="No-Break">most common.</span></p>
			<p>A literal number, such as 22, is considered an <strong class="source-inline">int</strong> by default. If you want to have 22 treated as <strong class="source-inline">long</strong> (instead of <strong class="source-inline">int</strong>), you must suffix either an uppercase or lowercase <em class="italic">L</em> to the literal. Here’s <span class="No-Break">an example:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
int x  = 10;long n = 10L;</pre>
			<p>As per <em class="italic">Table 2.1</em>, using a <strong class="source-inline">long</strong> as opposed to an <strong class="source-inline">int</strong>, gives you access to much bigger and much smaller numbers. Use of uppercase <strong class="source-inline">L</strong> as opposed to lowercase <strong class="source-inline">l</strong> to signify <strong class="source-inline">long</strong> is preferred, as the lowercase <strong class="source-inline">l</strong> is similar to the number <span class="No-Break">1 (one).</span></p>
			<p>Floating-point numbers behave similarly. A decimal number is, by default, <strong class="source-inline">double</strong>. To have any decimal number treated as <strong class="source-inline">float</strong> (as opposed to <strong class="source-inline">double</strong>), you must suffix the literal with either an uppercase or lowercase <strong class="source-inline">F</strong>. Assuming range is not an issue then one reason for using <strong class="source-inline">float</strong> as opposed to <strong class="source-inline">double</strong> is memory conservation (as <strong class="source-inline">float</strong> requires 4 bytes whereas <strong class="source-inline">double</strong> requires 8 bytes). Here’s <span class="No-Break">an example:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
double d = 10.34;float f  = 10.34F;</pre>
			<p>Variables of the <strong class="source-inline">char</strong> type are initialized with single quotes around the literal. Here’s <span class="No-Break">an example:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
char c = 'a';</pre>			<p>Variables of the <strong class="source-inline">boolean</strong> type can store only <strong class="source-inline">true</strong> or <strong class="source-inline">false</strong>. These <strong class="source-inline">boolean</strong> literals are in lowercase only as they are reserved words in Java, and Java <span class="No-Break">is case-sensitive:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
boolean b1 = true;boolean b2 = false;</pre>
			<p>That concludes this section<a id="_idIndexMarker148"/> on Java’s primitive type system, where we examined the various types, their sizes/ranges, and some <span class="No-Break">code segments.</span></p>
			<p>Now, let’s put the theory of variables and primitive types into practice! But before that, here’s a bit of a cheat code to help you with <span class="No-Break">the exercises.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-63"><a id="_idTextAnchor063"/>Screen output</h1>
			<p>As we know, <strong class="source-inline">System.out.println()</strong> outputs what is inside the <strong class="source-inline">()</strong>. To do the exercises, we <a id="_idIndexMarker149"/>want to expand on that. Firstly, here’s <span class="No-Break">some code:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
String name = "James";    // line 1int age = 23; // line 2
double salary = 50_000.0; // line 3
String out = "Details: "  +  name  +  ", "  +  age  +  ", "  +  salary;//line 4
System.out.println(out);  // line 5</pre>
			<p>Line 1 declares a string literal <strong class="source-inline">"James"</strong> and initializes the <strong class="source-inline">name</strong> variable with it. A string literal is a sequence of characters (including numbers), enclosed in double quotes. We will discuss the <strong class="source-inline">String</strong> class in detail in <a href="B19793_12.xhtml#_idTextAnchor293"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 12</em></span></a><span class="No-Break">.</span></p>
			<p>Lines 2 and 3 should<a id="_idIndexMarker150"/> be fine. We are declaring an <strong class="source-inline">int</strong> type called <strong class="source-inline">age</strong> and a <strong class="source-inline">double</strong> type called <strong class="source-inline">salary</strong> and using literal values to initialize them. The underscore used in line 3, enables us to make large numbers easier <span class="No-Break">to read.</span></p>
			<p>Line 4 builds the string to be output, namely <strong class="source-inline">out</strong>. We want to output the variables values, along with some helpful text to explain the output. Java builds the string from left <span class="No-Break">to right.</span></p>
			<p>Here, <strong class="source-inline">+</strong> is not the regular mathematical addition. We will discuss this in detail in <a href="B19793_03.xhtml#_idTextAnchor067"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 3</em></span></a>, but for the moment, realize that when you have a string variable or literal on the left or the right of <strong class="source-inline">+</strong>, the operation becomes a <strong class="source-inline">String</strong> append (as opposed to <span class="No-Break">mathematical addition).</span></p>
			<p>One property this append shares with addition is that both sides of <strong class="source-inline">+</strong> must be of the same type. Since not all the variables in this example are string variables (or literals), Java has some work to do in the background (to get them all to the same type). Java copies the numeric variable values into new string locations to use them in building the string. For example, there is a location somewhere in memory that’s been created for a string literal, “23” (in addition to the <strong class="source-inline">int</strong> location for <strong class="source-inline">age</strong>). This also happens for the <strong class="source-inline">double</strong> type’s <strong class="source-inline">salary</strong> variable. Now, Java is ready to construct the string and assign it to <strong class="source-inline">out</strong> (<span class="No-Break">line 4).</span></p>
			<p>In the <a id="_idIndexMarker151"/>background, Java performs <span class="No-Break">the following:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
"Details: " + "James" =&gt; "Details: James""Details: James" + ", " =&gt; "Details: James, "
"Details: James, " + "23" =&gt; "Details: James, 23"
"Details: James, 23" + ", " =&gt; "Details: James, 23,
"Details: James, 23, " + "50000.0" =&gt; "Details: James, 23,
  50000.0"</pre>
			<p>So, <strong class="source-inline">"Details: James, 23, 50000.0"</strong> is used to initialize <strong class="source-inline">out</strong>, which is what is displayed on the screen when executing <span class="No-Break">line 5.</span></p>

			<p>All is going great in our lovely dinosaur park. However, we do need to do some <span class="No-Break">administrative tasks:</span></p>
			<ol>
				<li>We need to keep track of the dinosaurs in the park. Declare variables to represent the breed, height, length, and weight of one dinosaur in the main method. Give the variables a value and <span class="No-Break">print them.</span></li>
				<li>Now, we want to do something similar to the program of exercise 1 and print the dinosaur’s age, name, and whether it’s a carnivore or not. This needs to happen in the main method. Give the variables a value and <span class="No-Break">print them.</span></li>
				<li>Our park is doing great! But it gets a bit too busy at times. The fire department advised us to introduce a maximum number of visitors that are allowed at any given time. Declare a variable to represent the maximum number of visitors allowed in the park per day. You can choose a reasonable value for the variable. Then, print it in the sentence: “There’s a maximum of [x] people allowed in <span class="No-Break">Mesozoic Eden.”</span></li>
				<li>Our team is an integral part of Mesozoic Eden. Let’s create a profile for an employee. Declare variables to represent the name and age of a Mesozoic Eden employee. Assign values and <span class="No-Break">print them.</span></li>
				<li>We would like to know how many dinosaurs we have at any time. Declare a variable to represent the number of dinosaurs in the park. Assign it a value and <span class="No-Break">print it.</span></li>
				<li>Safety is our priority. We maintain a safety rating scale to ensure our standards. Declare a variable to represent the park’s safety rating on a scale from 1 to 10. Assign a value to it and <span class="No-Break">print it.</span></li>
				<li>Now, let’s bring together some dinosaur information in one statement. Create a program that uses string concatenation to print out a dinosaur’s name, age, and diet (a string with a value of <strong class="source-inline">carnivore</strong> <span class="No-Break">or </span><span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">herbivore</strong></span><span class="No-Break">).</span></li>
				<li>Each dinosaur species has a unique name. For a quick referencing system, we use the first letter of a dinosaur species. Declare a character variable that represents the first letter of a dinosaur species, assign a value, and <span class="No-Break">print it.</span></li>
			</ol>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-65"><a id="_idTextAnchor065"/>Project – dinosaur profile generator</h1>
			<p>As<a id="_idIndexMarker152"/> part of your responsibilities in Mesozoic Eden, you are tasked with creating an extensive database of all the dinosaurs living in the park. For now, you only need to complete the first step: a profile generator. These profiles will not only help in keeping track of our prehistoric residents but also provide essential data for scientific study, healthcare, diet management, and <span class="No-Break">visitor engagement.</span></p>
			<p>In this project, we will focus on developing a program that can model an individual <span class="No-Break">dinosaur’s profile.</span></p>
			<p>The profile should include the <span class="No-Break">following characteristics:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><span class="No-Break">Name</span></li>
				<li><span class="No-Break">Age</span></li>
				<li><span class="No-Break">Species</span></li>
				<li>Diet (carnivore <span class="No-Break">or herbivore)</span></li>
				<li><span class="No-Break">Weight</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>Each characteristic should be stored as a variable within the program. Here’s your chance to get creative and think about the kind of dinosaur you want to describe. Is it a towering T-Rex or a friendly Stegosaurus? Maybe it’s a swift, scary Velociraptor or a <span class="No-Break">mighty Triceratops?</span></p>
			<p>Once you have declared and assigned values to these variables, the program should print out a complete profile of the dinosaur. The output can be something like <strong class="source-inline">"Meet [Name], a [Age]-year-old [Species]. As a [Diet], it has a robust weight of [</strong><span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">Weight] kilograms."</strong></span><span class="No-Break">.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-66"><a id="_idTextAnchor066"/>Summary</h1>
			<p>In this chapter, we learned that a variable is simply a memory location with a name and a value. To utilize variables, we have to know how to declare and <span class="No-Break">access them.</span></p>
			<p>To declare a variable, we specify the variable’s name and its type – for example, <strong class="source-inline">int countOfTitles=5;</strong>. This line of code declares an <strong class="source-inline">int</strong> variable named <strong class="source-inline">countOfTitles</strong> with a value of <strong class="source-inline">5</strong>. Naming them properly using camel case, is a great aid in making your code more readable and maintainable. To access the variable, we just specify the variable’s name – for <span class="No-Break">example, </span><span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">System.out.println(countOfTitles);</strong></span><span class="No-Break">.</span></p>
			<p>As Java is a strongly typed language, we have to specify a variables' type when we declare it. Java provides eight in-built primitive data types for our use. They are easily recognizable due to their lowercase letters. In the preceding line of code, <strong class="source-inline">int</strong> is the primitive data type for the <strong class="source-inline">countOfTitles</strong> variable. We saw the sizes in bytes of the primitive types, which determines their range of values. All numeric types are signed, with the most significant bit being used for the sign. The <strong class="source-inline">char</strong> type is unsigned and is 2 bytes in size so that Java can support any character in any language anywhere in the world. Using code snippets, we saw variables of the different types <span class="No-Break">in use.</span></p>
			<p>Now that we know how to declare and use variables, let’s move on to operators that enable us to <span class="No-Break">combine variables.</span></p>
