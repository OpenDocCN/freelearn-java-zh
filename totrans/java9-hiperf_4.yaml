    one process, we were able to keep illustrating it with vivid images (albeit in
    our imagination only) of pyramid building. Multiple thread management, based on
    the democratic principle of equality between thread pool members, had also a sense
    of centralized planning and supervision. Different priorities were assigned to
    threads programmatically, hardcoded (for most cases) after thoughtful consideration
    by the programmer in accordance with the expected load, and adjusted after monitoring.
    The upper limits of the available resources were fixed, although they could be
    increased after, again, a relatively big centralized decision.

    applications currently deployed to production. Many of them are monoliths, sealed
    inside a single `.ear` or `.war` file. This works fine for relatively small applications
    and a corresponding team size that supports them. They are easy (if the code is
    well structured) to maintain, build, and if the production load is not very high,
    they can be easily deployed. If the business does not grow or has little impact
    on the company's internet presence, they continue to do the job and will do so
    probably for the foreseeable future. Many service providers are eager to host
    such websites by charging a small fee and relieving the website owner of the technical
    worries of production maintenance not directly related to the business. But that
    is not the case for everybody.

- en: Some businesses have a higher demand for the deployment plan because of the
    need to keep up with the bigger volume of traffic. The natural answer to this
    challenge would be and was to add servers with the same `.ear` or `.war` file
    deployed and join all the servers into a cluster. So, one failed server could
    be automatically replaced with another one from the cluster, and the site user
    would never experience disconnect of the service. The database that backed all
    the clustered servers could be clustered too. A connection to each of the clusters
    went through a load balancer, making sure that none of the cluster members worked
    more than the others.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'The web server and database clustering help but only to a degree, because as
    the code base grows, its structure can create one or several bottlenecks unless
    such and similar issues are addressed with a scalable design. One of the ways
    to do it is to split the code into tiers: front end (or web tier), middle tier
    (or app tier) and back end (or backend tier). Then, again, each tier can be deployed
    independently (if the protocol between tiers has not changed) and in its own cluster
    of servers, as each tier can grow horizontally as needed independently of other
    tiers. Such a solution provides more flexibility for scaling up, but makes the
    deployment plan more complex, especially if the new code introduces breaking changes.
    One of the approaches is to create a second cluster that will host a new code,
    then take the servers one by one from the old cluster, deploy the new code, and
    put them in the new cluster. The new cluster would be turned on as soon as at
    least one server in each tier has the new code. This approach worked fine for
    the web and app tiers but was more complex for the backend, which once in a while
    required data migration and similar joyful exercises. Add to it unexpected outages
    in the middle of the deployment caused by human errors, defects in the code, pure
    accidents, or some combination of all the earlier mentioned (one time, for example,
    an electric power cable was cut by an excavator in the nearby construction site),
    and it is easy to understand why very few people love a deployment of a major
    release to production.'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Programmers, being by nature problem solvers, tried to prevent the earlier scenario
    as best as they could by writing defensive code, deprecating instead of changing,
    testing, and so on. One of the approaches was to break the application into more
    independently deployable parts with the hope of avoiding deploying everything
    at the same time. They called these independent units **services**, and **Service-Oriented
    Architecture** (**SOA**) was born.

- en: Unfortunately, in many companies, the natural growth of the code base was not
    adjusted to the new challenges in a timely manner. Like the frog that was eventually
    boiled in a slowly heated pot of water, they never had time to jump out of the
    hot spot by changing the design. It was always cheaper to add another feature
    to the blob of the existing functionality than redesign the whole app. Business
    metrics of the time-to-market and keeping the bottom line in the black always
    were and will remain the main criterion for the decision making, until the poorly
    structured source code eventually stops working, pulling down all the business
    transactions with it or, if the company is lucky, allows them to weather the storm
    and shows the importance of the investment in the redesign.

    their monolithic application still running as expected (maybe not for long, but
    who knows), some went out of business, some learned from their mistakes and progressed
    into the brave world of the new challenges, and others learned from their mistakes
    and designed their systems to be SOA upfront.

    has to be more responsible in maintaining the contract (social, in the case of
    a society, and API, in the case of the software) not only formally but also in
    spirit. Otherwise, for example, the data flowing from a new version of one component,
    although correct by type, might be unacceptable to another component by value
    (too big or too small). Maintaining a cross-team understanding and overlapping
    of responsibility requires constant vigilance in keeping the culture alive and
    enlightening. Encouraging innovation and risk taking, which can lead to a business
    breakthrough, contradict the protecting tendencies for stability and risk aversion
    coming from the same business people.

    just a software principle. It affects everybody in the company.

- en: Meanwhile, the industry leaders, who have managed to grow beyond anything we
    could imagine just a decade ago, were forced to solve even more daunting problems
    and came back to the software community with their solutions. And that is where
    our analogy with the pyramid building does not work anymore. Because the new challenge
    is not just to build something so big that was never built before but also to
    do it quickly not in a matter of years, but in a few weeks and even days. And
    the result has to last not for a thousand years but has to be able to evolve constantly
    and be flexible enough to adapt to new, unexpected requirements in real time.
    If only one aspect of the functionality has changed, we should be able to redeploy
    only this one service. If the demand for any service grows, we should be able
    to scale only along this one service and release resources when the demand drops.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To avoid big deployments with all hands on deck and to come closer to the continuous
    deployment (which decreases time-to-market and is thus supported by business),
    the functionality continued to split into smaller chunks of services. In response
    to the demand, more sophisticated and robust cloud environments, deployment tools
    (including containers and container orchestration), and monitoring systems supported
    this move. The reactive streams, described in the previous lesson, started to
    develop even before the Reactive Manifesto came out and plugged a snag into the
    stack of modern frameworks.

- en: Splitting an application into independent deployment units brought several not
    quite expected benefits that have increased the motivation for plowing ahead.
    The physical isolation of services allows more flexibility in choosing a programming
    language and platform of implementation. It helps not only to select technology
    that is the best for the job but also to hire people able to implement it, not
    being bound by a certain technological stack of the company. It also helped the
    recruiters to spread the net wider and use smaller cells for bringing in new talent,
    which is not a small advantage with a limited number of available specialists
    and the unlimited demand of the fast-growing data processing industry.

    lesson, we talked about threads synchronization. You could see that this problem
    was not easy to solve, and we have presented several possible ways to do it. Similar
    approaches can be applied toward microservices. Although they are run in different
    processes, they can communicate to each other if need be, so they can coordinate
    and synchronize their actions.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Special care has to be taken during modification of the same persistent data
    whether shared across databases, schemas, or tables within the same schema. If
    an eventual consistency is acceptable (which is often the case for larger sets
    of data, used for statistical purposes, for example) then no special measures
    are necessary. However, the need for transactional integrity poses a more difficult
    problem.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One way to support a transaction across several microservices is to create a
    service that would play the role of a **Distributed Transaction Manager** (**DTM**).
    Other services that need coordination would pass to it the new modified values.
    The DTM service could keep the concurrently modified data temporarily in a database
    table and would move it into the main table(s) in one transaction after all the
    data is ready (and consistent).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If the time to access the data is an issue or you need to protect the database
    from an excessive number of concurrent connections, dedicating a database to some
    services may be an answer. Alternatively, if you would like to try another option,
    memory cache could be the way to go. Adding a service that provides access to
    the cache (and updates it as needed) increases isolation from the services that
    use it, but requires (sometimes difficult) synchronization between the peers that
    are managing the same cache too.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: After considering all the options and possible solutions for data sharing, it
    is often helpful to revisit the idea of creating its own database (or schema)
    for each microservice. One may discover that the effort of the data isolation
    (and subsequent synchronization on the database level) does not look as daunting
    as before if compared with the effort to synchronize the data dynamically.

    Such an event-driven non-blocking programming model is a very good fit for reactive
    microservices. For certain types of code that are blocking by nature (JDBC calls
    and long computations are good examples) a worker verticle can be executed asynchronously
    (not by the event loop, but by a separate thread using the method `vertx.executeBlocking()`),

    an exception is generated. The `subscribe()` method has several overloaded versions.

    records not processed yet, the clause `for update` in the SQL query makes sure
    that only one gets each record, so they are not going to be processed twice. The
    significant advantage of the method `process()` code is its usage of the `rxQUeryStream()`
    operation that emits the found records one at a time so that they are processed
    independently of each other. In the case of a big number of not processed records,
    such a solution guarantees a smooth delivery of the results without the spiking
    of the resources consumption. The following `flatMap()` operation does processing
    using the function passed in. The only requirement for that function is that it
    must return one integer value (in `JsonArray`) that is going to be used as a parameter
    for the `SQL_INSERT_PROCESSED` statement. So, it is up to the code that calls
    this method to decide the nature of the processing. The rest of the code is similar
    to the method `insert()`. The code indentation helps to follow the nesting of
    the operations.

    original usage, a container was something that carried its content from one location
    to another without changing anything inside. However, when servers were introduced,
    only one aspect was emphasized the ability to hold an application to contain it.
    Also, another meaning was added to provide life-supportive infrastructure so that
    the container's content (an application) can not only survive but also be active
    and respond to the external requests. Such a redefined notion of a container was
    applied to web servers (servlet container), application servers (an application
    container with or without an EJB container), and other software facilities that
    provided the supportive environment for applications. Sometimes, even the JVM
    itself was called a container, but this association did not survive, probably,
    because the ability to actively engage (execute) the content does not align well
    with the original meaning of a container.

    a different location without any change to the contained code. If so, that would
    be quite an apt assumption. VM does allow all of that, and a modern container

    applications has only one operating system running, and the two containers share
    (read-only) the operating system kernel, each having its own access (mount) for
    writing to the resources they do not share. This means, for example, a much shorter

    infrastructure independence allows you, if necessary, to use a public cloud for
    development and testing and your own computers for production.

- en: Microservices is a new architectural and design solution for highly loaded processing
    systems that became popular after being successfully used in production by such
    giants as Amazon, Google, Twitter, Microsoft, IBM, and others. It does not mean
    though that you must adopt it too, but you can consider the new approach and see
    if some or any of it can help your applications to be more resilient and responsive.

    comes with increased complexity of the need to manage many more units through
    all the lifecycle from requirements and development through testing to production.
    Before committing to the full-scale microservice architecture, give it a shot
    by implementing just a few microservices and move them all the way to production.
    Then, let it run for some time and gauge the experience. It will be very specific
    to your organization. Any successful solution must not be blindly copied but adopted
    as fit for your particular needs and abilities.
