- en: As long as we kept talking about the designing, implementation, and tuning of
    one process, we were able to keep illustrating it with vivid images (albeit in
    our imagination only) of pyramid building. Multiple thread management, based on
    the democratic principle of equality between thread pool members, had also a sense
    of centralized planning and supervision. Different priorities were assigned to
    threads programmatically, hardcoded (for most cases) after thoughtful consideration
    by the programmer in accordance with the expected load, and adjusted after monitoring.
    The upper limits of the available resources were fixed, although they could be
    increased after, again, a relatively big centralized decision.

  zh: 只要我们一直在谈论一个过程的设计、实施和调整，我们就能用金字塔建造的生动图像（尽管只是我们想象中的）来展示它。基于线程池成员之间平等民主原则的多线程管理，也有一种集中规划和监督的感觉。线程的优先级被程序性地分配，在程序员经过深思熟虑后（对于大多数情况）硬编码，并根据预期的负载进行调整。可用的资源上限是固定的，尽管在再次做出相对较大的集中决策后，它们可以被增加。
- en: Such systems had great success and still constitute the majority of the web
    applications currently deployed to production. Many of them are monoliths, sealed
    inside a single `.ear` or `.war` file. This works fine for relatively small applications
    and a corresponding team size that supports them. They are easy (if the code is
    well structured) to maintain, build, and if the production load is not very high,
    they can be easily deployed. If the business does not grow or has little impact
    on the company's internet presence, they continue to do the job and will do so
    probably for the foreseeable future. Many service providers are eager to host
    such websites by charging a small fee and relieving the website owner of the technical
    worries of production maintenance not directly related to the business. But that
    is not the case for everybody.

  zh: 这些系统取得了巨大的成功，并且仍然构成了目前部署到生产中的大多数网络应用。其中许多是单体应用，密封在单个`.ear`或`.war`文件中。这对相对较小的应用和相应的支持团队规模来说效果很好。如果代码结构良好，它们易于维护、构建，并且如果生产负载不是非常高，它们可以轻松部署。如果业务没有增长或对公司的互联网存在影响不大，它们将继续完成工作，并且可能会在可预见的未来继续这样做。许多服务提供商都渴望通过收取少量费用来托管此类网站，从而减轻网站所有者与业务无关的生产维护的技术担忧。但并非所有人都如此。

- en: Some businesses have a higher demand for the deployment plan because of the
    need to keep up with the bigger volume of traffic. The natural answer to this
    challenge would be and was to add servers with the same `.ear` or `.war` file
    deployed and join all the servers into a cluster. So, one failed server could
    be automatically replaced with another one from the cluster, and the site user
    would never experience disconnect of the service. The database that backed all
    the clustered servers could be clustered too. A connection to each of the clusters
    went through a load balancer, making sure that none of the cluster members worked
    more than the others.

  zh: 一些企业对部署计划的需求更高，因为需要跟上更大流量的需求。应对这一挑战的自然答案，并且也是实际的做法，就是添加具有相同 `.ear` 或 `.war`
    文件的服务器，并将所有服务器加入到一个集群中。这样，一个失败的服务器可以被集群中的另一个服务器自动替换，而网站用户永远不会体验到服务的断开。支持所有集群服务器的数据库也可以进行集群。每个集群的连接都通过负载均衡器进行，确保集群中的任何成员都不会比其他成员工作得更多。
- en: 'The web server and database clustering help but only to a degree, because as
    the code base grows, its structure can create one or several bottlenecks unless
    such and similar issues are addressed with a scalable design. One of the ways
    to do it is to split the code into tiers: front end (or web tier), middle tier
    (or app tier) and back end (or backend tier). Then, again, each tier can be deployed
    independently (if the protocol between tiers has not changed) and in its own cluster
    of servers, as each tier can grow horizontally as needed independently of other
    tiers. Such a solution provides more flexibility for scaling up, but makes the
    deployment plan more complex, especially if the new code introduces breaking changes.
    One of the approaches is to create a second cluster that will host a new code,
    then take the servers one by one from the old cluster, deploy the new code, and
    put them in the new cluster. The new cluster would be turned on as soon as at
    least one server in each tier has the new code. This approach worked fine for
    the web and app tiers but was more complex for the backend, which once in a while
    required data migration and similar joyful exercises. Add to it unexpected outages
    in the middle of the deployment caused by human errors, defects in the code, pure
    accidents, or some combination of all the earlier mentioned (one time, for example,
    an electric power cable was cut by an excavator in the nearby construction site),
    and it is easy to understand why very few people love a deployment of a major
    release to production.'

  zh: 网络服务器和数据库集群虽然有所帮助，但仅限于一定程度，因为随着代码库的增长，其结构可能会产生一个或多个瓶颈，除非用可扩展的设计来解决类似问题。实现这一目标的一种方法是将代码分成层：前端（或网络层）、中间层（或应用层）和后端（或后端层）。然后，再次，每一层都可以独立部署（如果层之间的协议没有改变），并在其自己的服务器集群中部署，因为每一层可以根据需要独立地水平扩展，而不依赖于其他层。这种解决方案为扩展提供了更多的灵活性，但使得部署计划更加复杂，尤其是在新代码引入破坏性更改的情况下。其中一种方法是为新代码创建第二个集群，然后逐个从旧集群中取出服务器，部署新代码，并将它们放入新集群。一旦每个层的至少一个服务器都部署了新代码，新集群就会启动。这种方法对于网络和应用层来说效果良好，但对于后端来说则更为复杂，后端偶尔需要数据迁移和类似的愉快练习。再加上在部署过程中由于人为错误、代码缺陷、纯粹的事故或上述所有因素的某种组合而导致的意外中断，就不难理解为什么很少有人喜欢将主要版本发布到生产环境中了。
- en: Programmers, being by nature problem solvers, tried to prevent the earlier scenario
    as best as they could by writing defensive code, deprecating instead of changing,
    testing, and so on. One of the approaches was to break the application into more
    independently deployable parts with the hope of avoiding deploying everything
    at the same time. They called these independent units **services**, and **Service-Oriented
    Architecture** (**SOA**) was born.

- en: Unfortunately, in many companies, the natural growth of the code base was not
    adjusted to the new challenges in a timely manner. Like the frog that was eventually
    boiled in a slowly heated pot of water, they never had time to jump out of the
    hot spot by changing the design. It was always cheaper to add another feature
    to the blob of the existing functionality than redesign the whole app. Business
    metrics of the time-to-market and keeping the bottom line in the black always
    were and will remain the main criterion for the decision making, until the poorly
    structured source code eventually stops working, pulling down all the business
    transactions with it or, if the company is lucky, allows them to weather the storm
    and shows the importance of the investment in the redesign.

    their monolithic application still running as expected (maybe not for long, but

    although correct by type, might be unacceptable to another component by value
    (too big or too small). Maintaining a cross-team understanding and overlapping
    of responsibility requires constant vigilance in keeping the culture alive and

    do it quickly not in a matter of years, but in a few weeks and even days. And
    the result has to last not for a thousand years but has to be able to evolve constantly
    and be flexible enough to adapt to new, unexpected requirements in real time.
    If only one aspect of the functionality has changed, we should be able to redeploy

    Such an event-driven non-blocking programming model is a very good fit for reactive
    microservices. For certain types of code that are blocking by nature (JDBC calls
    and long computations are good examples) a worker verticle can be executed asynchronously
    (not by the event loop, but by a separate thread using the method `vertx.executeBlocking()`),
    which keeps the golden rule intact.

    and naming convention of RxJava. Nevertheless, we encourage you to go through
    Vert.x documentation, because it has a very rich API that covers many more cases
    than just demonstrated. In the previous code, the operation `flatMap()` receives
    the function that runs the script and then closes the connection. The operation
    `doAfterTerminate()` in this case acts as if it was placed inside a finally block
    in a traditional code and closes the connection either in case of success or if
    an exception is generated. The `subscribe()` method has several overloaded versions.
    For our code, we have selected the one that takes two functions one is going to
    be executed in the case of success (we print a message about the table being created)
    and another in the case of an exception (we just print the stack trace then).

    records not processed yet, the clause `for update` in the SQL query makes sure
    that only one gets each record, so they are not going to be processed twice. The
    significant advantage of the method `process()` code is its usage of the `rxQUeryStream()`
    operation that emits the found records one at a time so that they are processed
    independently of each other. In the case of a big number of not processed records,
    such a solution guarantees a smooth delivery of the results without the spiking
    of the resources consumption. The following `flatMap()` operation does processing
    using the function passed in. The only requirement for that function is that it
    must return one integer value (in `JsonArray`) that is going to be used as a parameter
    for the `SQL_INSERT_PROCESSED` statement. So, it is up to the code that calls
    this method to decide the nature of the processing. The rest of the code is similar
    to the method `insert()`. The code indentation helps to follow the nesting of
    the operations.

    original usage, a container was something that carried its content from one location
    to another without changing anything inside. However, when servers were introduced,
    only one aspect was emphasized the ability to hold an application to contain it.
    Also, another meaning was added to provide life-supportive infrastructure so that
    the container's content (an application) can not only survive but also be active
    and respond to the external requests. Such a redefined notion of a container was
    applied to web servers (servlet container), application servers (an application
    container with or without an EJB container), and other software facilities that
    provided the supportive environment for applications. Sometimes, even the JVM
    itself was called a container, but this association did not survive, probably,
    because the ability to actively engage (execute) the content does not align well
    with the original meaning of a container.

    advantages and disadvantages of this approach. We will discuss them not relative

    without using the traditional containers are quite obvious, starting with much
    fewer (if any) licensing costs and ending up with much a lighter deployment and
    scalability process, not even mentioning much less consumption of resources. Instead,
    we will compare container-less deployment not with the traditional one, but with

    grows (Google today deals with hundreds of thousands of deployment units at a
    time), it may become impossible to handle deployment via simple bash script and
    require a complex process that allows account ability for possible incompatibilities.

    modern containers (such as Docker, Rocket by CoreOS, VMware Photon, or similar)
    could get the impression that we were talking about VM while saying that a container
    could not only contain and execute the contained code, but also to move it to
    a different location without any change to the contained code. If so, that would
    be quite an apt assumption. VM does allow all of that, and a modern container
    can be considered a lightweight VM as it also allows the allocation of resources
    and provides the feeling of a separate machine. Yet, a container is not a full-blown
    isolated virtual computer.

    an entire operating system (with the application deployed). So, it is quite possible
    that a physical server running two VMs would have two different operating systems
    running on it. By contrast, a physical server (or a VM) running three containerized
    applications has only one operating system running, and the two containers share
    (read-only) the operating system kernel, each having its own access (mount) for
    writing to the resources they do not share. This means, for example, a much shorter
    start time, because starting a container does not require us to boot the operating
    system (as in the case of a VM).

    (or any other container for that matter). However, there are already mature systems
    of container management (in the world of containers called **orchestration**)
    that can help you with deployment, so the complexity of having many containers,
    although a valid consideration, should not be a big obstacle if resilience and
    responsiveness are at stake. One of the popular orchestrations called **Kubernetes**
    supports microservice registry, discovery, and load balancing. Kubernetes can
