The variety of features available within Cucumber bolsters and enhances experiences of implementing BDD for both business and development teams.</p><p>This cookbook has around 40 recipes. It takes you on a learning journey, where you start from basic concepts such as Feature files, Step Definitions, and then moves on to advanced concepts such as Hooks, Tags, configuration, and integration with Jenkins and test automation frameworks. Each chapter has multiple recipes, with the first recipe introducing the main concept of that chapter; the complexity level of each recipe increases as you progress through the chapter. The book has sufficient topics for product owners, business analysts, testers, developers, and everyone who wants to implement BDD.</p><p>This book is written with an assumption that the reader already has some idea about Cucumber. If you are new to Cucumber, it is advisable to go over my blog first:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><span class="strong"><strong>Blog 1</strong></span>: <span class="emphasis"><em>How to integrate Eclipse with Cucumber plugin</em></span> <a class="ulink" href="https://shankargarg.wordpress.com/2015/04/26/how-to-integrate-eclipse-with-cucumber-plugin/">https://shankargarg.wordpress.com/2015/04/26/how-to-integrate-eclipse-with-cucumber-plugin/</a></li><li class="listitem"><span class="strong"><strong>Blog 2</strong></span>: <span class="emphasis"><em>Create a Cucumber Project by Integrating Maven-Cucumber-Selenium-Eclipse</em></span> <a class="ulink" href="https://shankargarg.wordpress.com/2015/04/29/create-a-cucumber-project-by-integrating-maven-cucumber-selenium-eclipse/">https://shankargarg.wordpress.com/2015/04/29/create-a-cucumber-project-by-integrating-maven-cucumber-selenium-eclipse/</a></li></ul></div><p>These two blogs will help you integrate Cucumber and Eclipse and help you create and run a basic project.</p><p>All of the code explained in this book is committed on GitHub.

<a class="link" title="Chapter 1. Writing Feature Files" href="part0015.xhtml#aid-E9OE1">Chapter 1</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Writing Feature Files</em></span>, covers unique aspect of Cucumber – the Gherkin language and usage of Gherkin language to write meaningful and smart Feature files. This chapter will also cover different keywords, such as files Scenario, Steps, Scenario Outlines, and Data Tables.</p><p>
<a class="link" title="Chapter 2. Creating Step Definitions" href="part0026.xhtml#aid-OPEK1">Chapter 2</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Creating Step Definitions</em></span>, covers basic concepts and usage of Glue Code/Step Definitions, and regular expressions to come up with efficient and optimized Step Definitions. This chapter will also elaborate the concept of String and Data Table transformations.</p><p>
<a class="link" title="Chapter 3. Enabling Fixtures" href="part0036.xhtml#aid-12AK81">Chapter 3</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Enabling Fixtures</em></span>, covers the advanced concepts of implementing fixtures by Tags and Hooks. Here not only the individual concepts of Tags and Hooks are explained, but practical example of using Tags and Hooks combination is also explained.</p><p>
<a class="link" title="Chapter 4. Configuring Cucumber" href="part0042.xhtml#aid-181NK1">Chapter 4</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Configuring Cucumber</em></span>, deals with integration of Cucumber with JUnit and the concept of Cucumber Options.
