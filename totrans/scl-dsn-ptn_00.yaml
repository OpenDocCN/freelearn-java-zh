- en: Software engineering and design has existed for many years now. We use software
    almost everywhere in our lives, and this makes programs distinct in terms of the
    problems they solve.

- en: Regardless of the number of things that can be done with programming, there
    are still some specific features that repeat over and over again. Over time, people
    have come up with some best practices that help to tackle specific patterns that
    emerge in programs. These are called design patterns.

- en: Design patterns solve not only commonly occurring problems, but also deal with
    language limitations. No matter what the specific design patterns are and what
    single issue they solve, all of them in the end aim at producing better software.
    This includes improved readability, simplicity, easier maintainability, testability,
    extendibility, and efficiency. Today, design patterns are an important part of
    every good software engineer's arsenal.

- en: Together with the large number of problems that we tackle with programming,
    there are also many languages that we can use. Every language is different and
    has its strengths and weaknesses, so we also need to take this into consideration
    when doing something. In this book, we will look at design patterns from the point
    of view of Scala.

- en: Scala has become extremely popular in the last couple of years, and the numbers
    using it keep growing. Many companies use it in production for various purposes—big
    data processing, writing APIs, machine learning, and so on. Switching to Scala
    from popular languages, such as Java, turns out to be quite simple because it
    is a hybrid of an object-oriented language and a functional programming language.
    Using Scala to its full potential, however, requires us to be familiar with not
    only the object-oriented features, but also with the functional ones. The use
    of Scala could improve performance and the time it takes to implement the features.
    One of the reasons is the really high expressivity of Scala.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The fact that Scala is close to object-oriented languages means that many of
    the design patterns for object-oriented programming are still applicable here.
    The fact that it is also functional means that some other design patterns are
    also applicable, and some of the object-oriented ones could be modified to better
    fit the paradigm of Scala. In this book, we will be focusing on all of them—we
    will go through some specific features of Scala and then look at the popular Gang
    of Four design patterns viewed from the Scala perspective. We will also become
    familiar with design patterns that are exclusive to Scala and understand different
    functional programming concepts, including monoids and monads. Having meaningful
    examples always makes learning and understanding easier. We will try to provide
    examples that you can easily map to real problems that you would potentially be
    solving. We will also introduce some libraries that will be useful for anyone
    who writes real-world applications.

- en: This book is aimed for people who already have some knowledge of Scala, but
    want to get a more practical understanding of how to apply it in real-world application
    development. This book is also useful as a reference to consult while designing
    applications. Having an understanding of the importance of using best practices
    and writing nice code is good; however, even if you don't, hopefully, you will
    be convinced by the time you finish reading this book. Prior knowledge of design
    patterns is not required, but if you are familiar with some, this book will be
    useful, as we will take a look at them from the point of view of Scala.

- en: This book assumes that the reader is already familiar with Scala. We have provided
    examples for each chapter in projects using Maven and SBT. You should have some
    knowledge of either one of these tools and have it installed on your machine.
    You are also recommended to have a modern and up-to-date IDE installed on your
    computer, for example, IntelliJ. You are encouraged to open the actual projects,
    as the examples in this book focus on the design patterns and, in some cases,
    imports are omitted in favor of space.
