			<p>A solid software architecture combines every building block required to bring a tech solution to life. In the early days of an application’s life, the design and practices are established: microservice or monolith architecture, event-driven approach, the integration and delivery application life cycle, containerization, and so on. Restricting the application side, especially in a Java context, frameworks and execution runtimes are also defined. Like the good old legacy systems, most modern cloud-native solutions rely on data, generally in data stores (e.g., databases). Unfortunately, the persistence layer is often left aside and not treated with the same importance as these other topics. For scenarios dependent on stateful services, this is the beginning of the end – the brand-new solution is doomed for a life of performance struggles and reduced maintainability, or even worse, might have ingrained weeds causing data inconsistency. The reduced maintainability is a result of the neglect in the persistence layer design and definitions, as schemes and data models are poorly implemented on top of insufficient information. In such scenarios, even trivial database refactorings are brutal <span class="No-Break">and time-consuming.</span></p>
			<p>Having a panoramic understanding of the challenges, solutions, and best practices of the persistence layer, technologies, and existing approaches is the way out of such troublesome scenarios and many more related to applications and <span class="No-Break">data stores.</span></p>
			<p>This book presents well-established patterns and standards that can be used in Java solutions, with valuable pros and cons of the trendy technologies and frameworks used in cloud-native microservices when confronted with good Java coding practices. As Java technologies have been broadly used for over two decades now, cloud adoption puts extra challenges on the table, such as the growing need for cost reduction through stack modernization. So, you will learn about application modernization strategies and gain in-depth knowledge about how enterprise data integration patterns and event-driven architectures enable smooth modernization processes with low-to-zero impact on the existing <span class="No-Break">legacy stack.</span></p>
			<p>After reading this book, your next architectural decision will be solid and backed by a thorough explanation of data storage options and their respective recommended usage scenarios, covering technologies such as SQL, NoSQL, and NewSQL. When talking about data-related content tailored within a Java ecosystem’s context, extensive information is available on topics such as how MicroProfile and Jakarta EE work; database patterns (such as Active Record and <strong class="bold">Data Access Object</strong> (<strong class="bold">DAO</strong>); <strong class="bold">Command and Query Responsibility Segregation</strong> (<strong class="bold">CQRS</strong>); in-memory persistence; and frameworks for <span class="No-Break">object mapping.</span></p>
			<p>If, at this point, you understand the reasons why the careful handling of data storage is crucial for a system and architecture and believe it has a direct impact on the whole organization, to the point of adding such value that businesses strive to beat their competitors by adopting data-centric strategies, then this book is for you. Get ready to join us on this exciting journey of exploring data, its mysteries, and its treasures in a <span class="No-Break">cloud-driven era.</span></p>

			<h1 id="_idParaDest-7"><a id="_idTextAnchor006"/>What this book covers</h1>
			<p><a href="B19375_01.xhtml#_idTextAnchor014"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 1</em></span></a>, <em class="italic">Storing Data: from the Caves to the Clouds</em>, is where you will acquire the foundation knowledge you’ll need for what’s coming next in the book, so buckle up. You will learn about the challenges of storing data, which gave birth to the first data storage solutions. As technology advanced, databases evolved into robust and reliable solutions. The Java ecosystem responded well and grew along with the data ecosystem, providing users with frameworks, application servers, and so on to allow for a simpler developer experience yet deliver performant <span class="No-Break">database integration.</span></p>
			<p><a href="B19375_02.xhtml#_idTextAnchor027"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 2</em></span></a>, <em class="italic">Distilling the Multiple Database Flavors</em>, discusses how a polyglot persistence strategy naturally materializes with the growth and individual needs of decoupled and independent services. You will explore different ways to store data, market data management systems (e.g., relational, NoSQL, and NewSQL), their respective languages, and, most importantly, the use case scenarios for each of them. Overengineering is the villain in system design, so this chapter will prepare you with the knowledge to keep it far from your <span class="No-Break">persistence layer.</span></p>
