- en: Vaadin Framework is an open source Java web framework released under the Apache
    License. The framework is well documented, includes sophisticated UI components
    and themes, has been battle-tested in real-life applications, and is supported
    by a committed company and a vibrant community that contributes to the framework
    through forum answers and hundreds of add-ons.

- en: Vaadin Framework allows developers to implement web user interfaces using Java
    code that runs on the server's JVM. The UI is rendered as HTML5 on the browser.
    The framework provides fully automated communication between the browser and the
    server through a programming model close to Swing or AWT. This allows developers/programmers
    bringing the benefits of object-oriented techniques to the presentation layer
    in web applications.
