- en: Dropwizard is a Java development framework for RESTful Web Services. It was
    initially built by Yammer to be used as the base of their backend systems. Dropwizard
    is production-ready; it encapsulates everything you will need for RESTful development.

- en: Jersey, Jackson, jDBI, and Hibernate are only some of the libraries bundled
    with Dropwizard. Applications built on Dropwizard run on an embedded Jetty server—you
    don't need to worry where to deploy your application or whether it is compatible
    with your target container.

    service application efficiently with minimum effort and time.

- en: Dropwizard is open source, and all of its modules are available though Maven
    repositories. That way, you are able to integrate every library you wish—if it's
    not already present—just by adding the appropriate dependency entry on your `pom.xml`
    file. Basic knowledge and understanding of Maven is required.

    book, you will need a computer with a Linux, Windows, or OS X operating system.
    A modern Java code editor/ IDE such as Eclipse, Netbeans, or IDEA is really going
    to help you. You will also need Version 7 of Java Development Kit (JDK) as well
    as Maven and MySQL server. Additional dependencies will be fetched by Maven, so
    you will need a working Internet connection.
