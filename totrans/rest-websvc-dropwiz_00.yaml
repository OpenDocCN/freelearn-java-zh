- en: Dropwizard is a Java development framework for RESTful Web Services. It was
    initially built by Yammer to be used as the base of their backend systems. Dropwizard
    is production-ready; it encapsulates everything you will need for RESTful development.

- en: Jersey, Jackson, jDBI, and Hibernate are only some of the libraries bundled
    with Dropwizard. Applications built on Dropwizard run on an embedded Jetty server—you
    don't need to worry where to deploy your application or whether it is compatible
    with your target container.

- en: Using Dropwizard, you will be able to build a fast, secure, and scalable web
    service application efficiently with minimum effort and time.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Dropwizard is open source, and all of its modules are available though Maven
    repositories. That way, you are able to integrate every library you wish—if it's
    not already present—just by adding the appropriate dependency entry on your `pom.xml`
    file. Basic knowledge and understanding of Maven is required.

    Started with Dropwizard*, will guide you through the basics of Dropwizard, helping
    you to get familiar with its concepts and also prepare your development environment.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[Chapter 2](ch02.html "Chapter 2. Creating a Dropwizard Application"), *Creating
    a Dropwizard Application*, will introduce Maven and how to use it to create a
    Dropwizard application. This covers generating the structure of an empty application,
    based on the default artifact, and the necessary modifications required in order
    to start building a Dropwizard application.'

- en: '[Chapter 3](ch03.html "Chapter 3. Configuring the Application"), *Configuring
    the Application*, presents the methods available to externalize your application''s
    configuration by enabling the use of a configuration file along with a configuration
    class that is tasked with fetching, validating, and making the configuration values
    available throughout the application.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[Chapter 4](ch04.html "Chapter 4. Creating and Adding REST Resources"), *Creating
    and Adding REST Resources*, will guide you through the implementations of your
    application''s most important aspect: the resource class. You will learn how to
    map URI paths and HTTP verbs to methods of the resource class and how to add new
    resources to a Dropwizard application.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[Chapter 5](ch05.html "Chapter 5. Representations – RESTful Entities"), *Representations
    – RESTful Entities*, deals with the modeling of representations to actual Java
    classes and how the POJOs are automatically transformed to JSON representations
    by Jackson.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[Chapter 6](ch06.html "Chapter 6. Using a Database"), *Using a Database*, demonstrates
    the integration and usage of jDBI, how to create data access objects from interfaces,
    and using jDBI''s SQL Object API in order to interact with the database. The additional
    configuration modifications needed are also presented in this chapter.'

    Web Service Requests*, presents the usage of Hibernate Validator in order to validate
    requests from a web service client prior to fulfilling them.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[Chapter 8](ch08.html "Chapter 8. The Web Service Client"), The *Web Service
    Client*, demonstrates how to create a managed Jersey HTTP client to be used by
    a Dropwizard application in order to interact with web services through `WebResource`
    objects.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[Chapter 9](ch09.html "Chapter 9. Authentication"), *Authentication*, goes
    through the basics of web service authentication and guides you through the implementation
    of a basic HTTP authenticator and how to adapt it to the resource class as well
    as the HTTP client of your application.'

- en: '[Chapter 10](ch10.html "Chapter 10. The User Interface – Views"), *The User
    Interface – Views*, shows the usage of the Dropwizard views bundle and the Mustache

    a Dropwizard Application*, demonstrates the usage of Dropwizard''s testing module
    for the creation of automated integration tests. This appendix also deals with
    the implementation of runtime tests for our application, which are known as health
    checks. You will be guided through the implementation of a health check that ensures
    that your HTTP client can indeed interact with a web service.'

    book, you will need a computer with a Linux, Windows, or OS X operating system.
    A modern Java code editor/ IDE such as Eclipse, Netbeans, or IDEA is really going
    to help you. You will also need Version 7 of Java Development Kit (JDK) as well
    as Maven and MySQL server. Additional dependencies will be fetched by Maven, so
    you will need a working Internet connection.
