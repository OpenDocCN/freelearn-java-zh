- en: Welcome to the world of Spring Batch! We're pleased that you have chosen our
    book, fully dedicated to the essentials of Spring Batch 3.0.2 release. Before
    we get started with this book, I would like to give an overview of how this book
    is organized and how you can get the most out of it. Once you have completed reading
    this book, you should be familiar with key batch processing concepts and understand
    how to solve the majority of the real-world problems that you will need to solve
    with Spring Batch. This book gives an insight of the essential concepts and applications
    of the Spring Batch framework, which will allow you to handle any unexpected use
    cases the book does not cover.

- en: Spring Batch is an open source, lightweight, and comprehensive solution, designed
    to enable the development of robust batch applications, vital for enterprise operations.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This tutorial starts with an insight into batch applications and Spring Batch
    offerings. Understanding the architecture and key components, you will learn how
    to develop and execute a batch application. You can then walk through the essential
    configurations and execution techniques, key technical implementations of the
    read and write, and processing features of different forms of data. Next, you
    will move onto the key features, such as transaction management, job flows, job
    monitoring, and data sharing across the steps of the executing jobs. Finally,
    you will learn how Spring Batch can integrate with diverse enterprise technologies
    and facilitate optimization and performance improvement with scaling and partitioning
    techniques.

- en: This book uses a simple application based on Spring Batch to illustrate how
    to solve real-world problems. The application is intended to be very simple and
    straightforward, and purposely contains very little functionality—the goal of
    this application is to encourage you to focus on the Spring Batch concepts, and
    not get tied up in the complexities of application development. You will have
    a much easier time following the book if you take the time to review the sample
    application source code. Some tips on getting started are found in the appendix.
