But, until now, there hasn't been a thorough, accessible resource for monitoring and troubleshooting purposes. We've found that Elasticsearch monitoring tools drastically improve our ability to solve cluster issues and greatly increase cluster reliability and performance as a result. We wrote this book to share those use cases and the insights that came out of them.</p><p>This book covers how to use several popular open source and commercial Elasticsearch monitoring tools, namely, Elasticsearch-head, Bigdesk, Marvel, Kopf, and Kibana. There's also a section on the Elasticsearch cat API and how to use Nagios to perform general system monitoring. Moreover, we will discuss several case studies with real-world examples of troubleshooting Elasticsearch issues using these tools.</p><p>We believe that the best way to learn is to do. In this book, we'll go over how to set up a sample Elasticsearch cluster and load it with data. At times, we'll deliberately introduce problems into the cluster so that we can see how the errors are tracked using our various monitoring tools. Following along with these examples in your own cluster will help you learn both how to use the monitoring tools and how to tackle new and unknown issues that may arise.</p><p>After reading this book, we hope that you will be better equipped to run and maintain an Elasticsearch cluster. You will also be more prepared to diagnose and solve cluster issues, such as a node going down, the Elasticsearch process dying, configuration errors, shard errors, <code class="literal">OutOfMemoryError</code> exceptions, slow queries, and slow indexing performance.</p><div class="section" title="What this book covers"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl1sec02"/>What this book covers</h1></div></div></div><p>

<div class="section" title="What you need for this book"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl1sec03"/>What you need for this book</h1></div></div></div><p>To follow along with the examples in this book, you'll need a real or virtualized three-node Elasticsearch cluster. You may optionally want two other nodes to run Marvel and Nagios, covered in <a class="link" href="ch04.html" title="Chapter 4. Marvel Dashboard">Chapter 4</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Marvel Dashboard,</em></span> and <a class="link" href="ch05.html" title="Chapter 5. System Monitoring">Chapter 5</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>System Monitoring,</em></span> respectively. It is possible to run Marvel and Nagios on the same host as a node in your Elasticsearch cluster, but you shouldn't do this in a production cluster. Check out VMWare Player (<a class="ulink" href="https://www.vmware.com/products/player">https://www.vmware.com/products/player</a>) and VirtualBox (<a class="ulink" href="https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads">https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads</a>) for standing up your own virtual five-node environment or Amazon EC2 (<a class="ulink" href="https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/">https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/</a>) for building a cluster in the cloud.</p><p>For your Elasticsearch nodes, you'll need a 64-bit version of Windows, Mac OS X, or Linux and a recent distribution of the Java Runtime Environment. The CPU speed doesn't matter as much on these hosts, but we recommend that you have at least 512 MB of memory per node. We use Ubuntu 14.04 and Oracle Java 7 for all examples in this book, but any modern operating system and either OpenJDK or Oracle Java 7 and 8 will work for running through the examples. The only exception is Nagios, which needs to run on Linux.</p><p>You will need the following software packages:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Java 7 or Java 8 (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html">http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html</a>)</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Elasticsearch 2.3.2 (<a class="ulink" href="https://www.elastic.co/downloads/past-releases/elasticsearch-2-3-2">https://www.elastic.co/downloads/past-releases/elasticsearch-2-3-2</a>)</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Elasticsearch-head (<a class="ulink" href="https://github.com/mobz/elasticsearch-head">https://github.com/mobz/elasticsearch-head</a>)</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Bigdesk (<a class="ulink" href="http://bigdesk.org/">http://bigdesk.org/</a>) </li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Marvel—free for development, subscription fee for use in production (<a class="ulink" href="https://www.elastic.co/downloads/marvel">https://www.elastic.co/downloads/marvel</a>)</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Kibana (<a class="ulink" href="https://www.elastic.co/downloads/kibana">https://www.elastic.co/downloads/kibana</a>)</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Kopf (<a class="ulink" href="https://github.com/lmenezes/elasticsearch-kopf">https://github.com/lmenezes/elasticsearch-kopf</a>)</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Nagios (<a class="ulink" href="https://www.nagios.org/downloads/">https://www.nagios.org/downloads/</a>)</li></ul></div><p>All of these software packages are free and open source except for Marvel, which is only free for use in development.</p><p>Finally, several examples in this book use the <code class="literal">curl</code> (<a class="ulink" href="https://curl.haxx.se/">https://curl.haxx.se/</a>) command-line utility for making REST calls to Elasticsearch and, optionally, Python 2.7 for pretty-printing the results.</p></div>
<div class="section" title="Who this book is for"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl1sec04"/>Who this book is for</h1></div></div></div><p>This book is for software developers, DevOps engineers, and system administrators who use Elasticsearch. We'll cover the basics of Elasticsearch to get a simple cluster installed and configured, but we will avoid going into detail about the Elasticsearch API. Thus, a basic understanding of the Elasticsearch API may be helpful, though not required, to understand this book.</p></div>
