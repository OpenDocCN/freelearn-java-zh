- en: With growing demands, organizations are looking for systems that are robust
    and scalable. Hence the Spring Framework has become the most popular framework
    for Java development. It not only simplifies software development but also improves
    developer productivity. This book covers effective ways to develop robust applications
    in Java using Spring.

    World – the CMS Application*, will begin by getting our hands dirty with Spring
    Initializr to create configurations for our CMS application. We will then learn

    in the previous chapter. Here we will learn how to persist data on a real database
    by learning about Spring Data Reactive MongoDB and PostgresSQL. We will finally
    learn about Project Reactor which will help you to create a non-blocking application
    in the JVM ecosystem.'
