<p><a href="87add83e-e65b-4b58-9ef1-113ad157a51a.xhtml">Chapter 1</a>, <em>Creating an Application to List World Countries with their GDP</em><span>, is about kick-starting your Spring-based web application development. We will focus on creating a web application using Spring MVC, Spring Data, and the World Bank API for some statistics on different countries, and a MySQL database. The core data for the application will be from the sample world database that comes with MySQL. The UI for this application will be powered by Angular.js. We will follow the WAR model for application deployment and will deploy on the latest version of Tomcat.</span></p>
<p><a href="64385ee5-943c-4d39-a452-a2a743936fdd.xhtml">Chapter 2</a>, <em>Building a Reactive Web Application</em><span>, is about building a RESTful web services application purely using Spring's new WebFlux framework. Spring WebFlux is a new framework that helps create reactive applications in a functional way.</span></p>
<p><a href="e32452e8-07bb-4815-96d6-b0db0a6009ba.xhtml">Chapter 3</a>, <em>Blogpress – A Simple Blog Management System</em><span>, is about creating a simple Spring Boot-based blog management system that uses Elasticsearch as the data store. We will also implement user roles management, authentication, and authorization using Spring Security. </span></p>
<p><a href="e36170b7-dbc6-4a4c-b7ba-e4830cd71efd.xhtml">Chapter 4</a>, <em>Building a Central Authentication Server</em><span>, is about building an application that will act as an authentication and authorization server. We will make use of the OAuth2 protocol and LDAP to build a central application that supports authentication and authorization.</span></p>
<p><a href="2473f10c-1a4e-4356-a3ec-fdf4a3d7683c.xhtml">Chapter 5</a>, <em>Application to View Countries and Their GDP Using JHipster</em><span>, revisits the application we developed in <a href="87add83e-e65b-4b58-9ef1-113ad157a51a.xhtml">Chapter 1</a>, <em>Creating an Application to List World Countries with their GDP,</em> and we'll develop the same application using JHipster. JHipster helps with the development of Spring Boot and Angular.js production-ready applications, and we will explore the platform and learn about its features and functionality.</span></p>
<p><a href="040a6977-5f6d-4866-ba38-ff33f8040ce0.xhtml">Chapter 6</a>, <em>Creating an Online Bookstore</em><span>, is about creating an online store that sells books by developing a web application in a layered fashion.</span></p>
<p><a href="0ae6a97e-710f-42c9-9aa3-74c554c3da08.xhtml">Chapter 7</a>, <em>Task Management System Using Spring and Kotlin</em><span>, looks at building a task management system using Spring Framework and Kotlin.</span></p>

                    <h1 class="header-title">Conventions used</h1>
                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>There are a number of text conventions used throughout this book.</p>
<p><kbd>CodeInText</kbd>: <span>Indicates c</span>ode words in text, database table names, folder names, filenames, file extensions, pathnames, dummy URLs, user input, and Twitter handles. <span>Here is an example:</span> "<span>The preceding line has to be added between the </span><kbd>&lt;Host&gt;&lt;/Host&gt;</kbd><span> tags.</span>"</p>
<p>A block of code is set as follows:</p>
<pre>&lt;depedency&gt;<br/> &lt;groupId&gt;org.springframework.boot&lt;/groupId&gt;<br/> &lt;artifactId&gt;spring-boot-starter-security&lt;/artifactId&gt;<br/>&lt;/dependency&gt;</pre>
<p>When we wish to draw your attention to a particular part of a code block, the relevant lines or items are set in bold:</p>
<pre>&lt;depedency&gt;<br/>  <strong>&lt;groupId&gt;org.springframework.boot&lt;/groupId&gt;</strong><br/>  &lt;artifactId&gt;spring-boot-starter-security&lt;/artifactId&gt;<br/>&lt;/dependency&gt;</pre>
<p>Any command-line input or output is written as follows:</p>
<pre><strong>$ mvn package</strong> </pre>
<p><strong>Bold</strong>: Indicates a new term, an important word, or w<span>ords that you see onscreen. For example, words in menus or dialog boxes appear in the text like this. Here is an example: "Download STS, unzip it in your local folder, and open the <kbd>.exe</kbd> file to start the STS. Once started, create a new <span class="packt_screen">Spring Starter Project</span> of the <span class="packt_screen">Spring Boot</span> type with the following attributes.</span><span>"</span></p>
<div class="packt_infobox">Warnings or important notes appear like this.</div>
<div class="packt_tip">Tips and tricks appear like this.</div>
