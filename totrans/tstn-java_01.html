			<h1 id="_idParaDest-18"><a id="_idTextAnchor018"/>Understanding Java Distributions</h1>
			<p>In this chapter, we will examine how the <strong class="bold">Java</strong> language came about and how it is managed. While the word <em class="italic">Java</em> is used throughout this book, please note that I am referring to the <strong class="bold">Java Standard Edition</strong> or <strong class="bold">Java SE</strong>. There are numerous versions and distributions of Java, and this sometimes leads to confusion over which one to use. Is Java free, or do I have to license it? Can I include a Java runtime with my software? Can I distribute my own version of Java? These and other questions will be answered in this chapter. </p>
			<p>You will learn how to install Java on Linux, macOS, and Windows. The significant tools that are part of the Java installation are highlighted in this chapter and will be used in later chapters.</p>
			<p><a id="_idTextAnchor019"/>We will cover the following topics in this chapter:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>A little history</li>
				<li>What makes Java special?</li>
				<li>Why are there many distributions of Java?</li>
				<li>Which Java should you get?</li>
				<li>How is Java licensed?</li>
				<li>Why are there so many versions of Java?</li>
				<li>Installing Java</li>
				<li>What’s in the box?</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Let’s begin with a quick history lesson.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-19"><a id="_idTextAnchor020"/>Technical requirements</h1>
			<p>To code in Java or run Java programs on your desktop, you need a computer and operating system that supports the <strong class="bold">Java Development Kit</strong> (<strong class="bold">JDK</strong>). There are JDKs available for different operating systems and different <strong class="bold">central processing units</strong> (<strong class="bold">CPUs</strong>). If you are running the Windows operating system, your only concern is whether you are running 32-bit or 64-bit. On macOS, there are versions of Java for both Intel and Apple (ARM) CPUs. If your operating system is Linux, there are more variations depending on your computer’s hardware. There is even a version of Java for IBM mainframes that run Linux.</p>
			<p>The only other hardware requirement is the amount of RAM on your system. I have run Java applications on a Raspberry Pi 3 Model B with just 1 GB of RAM. As a developer, you are doing more than just running programs. You run editors, compilers, web servers, database servers, and your usual software. Doing this needs memory. I recommend a minimum of 8 GB for a development system; 16 GB is ideal, and 32 GB might let you play games while you code.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-20"><a id="_idTextAnchor021"/>A little history</h1>
			<p>Java<a id="_idIndexMarker000"/> did not start as a language called Java. In the early 1990s, the company <strong class="bold">Sun Microsystems</strong>, known for its SPARC workstations and the Solaris operating <a id="_idIndexMarker001"/>system, saw potential in the consumer electronics space. They put <a id="_idIndexMarker002"/>together a team of engineers to develop products in this space under the title <strong class="bold">Green Project</strong>. Their first device was <a id="_idIndexMarker003"/>called the <strong class="bold">Star7</strong>, a small handheld computer that used a custom version of Solaris. The Star7 is the first personal digital assistant, preceding the Apple Newton by a year. As part of the development of Star7, a language was created. James Gosling, a Canadian software engineer <a id="_idIndexMarker004"/>working for Sun, led a team that developed this new language for the Star7, called <strong class="bold">Oak</strong>. The Star7 never went into production, but Oak was destined to take over the world.</p>
			<p>One of the consumer electronics targets Sun hoped that the Star7 could be used for was set-top boxes for the cable TV industry. They set up a company called FirstPerson and made a bid to develop a set-top box for the cable provider Time Warner. They lost the bid. While they were unsuccessful in bringing the Star7 to market, they saw potential in the Oak language. The only problem was that Oak was already trademarked.</p>
			<p>There<a id="_idIndexMarker005"/> are numerous stories about how Oak became Java. Was it named after their favorite beverage or an island in Indonesia? Java was just 1 of 12 possible names. The names were turned over to the legal department for trademark <a id="_idIndexMarker006"/>searches. Of the names on the list given to the legal team, Java was the fourth name on the list and the first to pass the legal review. Java became the new name for Oak.</p>
			<p>The early 1990s was<a id="_idIndexMarker007"/> also the time that the <strong class="bold">World Wide Web</strong> (<strong class="bold">WWW</strong>) became available to anyone with an internet connection. The Green team developed a browser called WebRunner<a id="_idIndexMarker008"/> coded with Java as a showcase for the language. This browser could run <a id="_idIndexMarker009"/>programs called Applets, which were written in Java. Java 1.0 was introduced to the world in 1995, and WebRunner was<a id="_idIndexMarker010"/> renamed HotJava. Netscape also licensed Java for their Navigator browser. </p>
			<p>In 1998 Java 1.2, also referred to as Java 2, was <a id="_idIndexMarker011"/>introduced. Among many new features was the <strong class="bold">Swing GUI library</strong>, which<a id="_idIndexMarker012"/> significantly improved writing desktop GUI programs that ran independently from a browser. The <strong class="bold">Java EE</strong> platform was released in 1999 as <strong class="bold">J2EE</strong>. It<a id="_idIndexMarker013"/> was used to <a id="_idIndexMarker014"/>develop Java web servers. Now, you could write Java programs that responded to requests from a browser and were run on a web server. The rest, as the expression goes, is history.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-21"><a id="_idTextAnchor022"/>What makes Java special?</h1>
			<p>Java was<a id="_idIndexMarker015"/> designed by Gosling and his team to address shortcomings they perceived in <strong class="bold">C++</strong>. The<a id="_idIndexMarker016"/> most significant of the shortcomings was memory management. In C++, variables of type pointer were used to allocate memory for objects. Once an object was no longer needed, the developer’s responsibility was to release or deallocate the memory. Forgetting to do so resulted<a id="_idIndexMarker017"/> in memory leaks. A leak is a block of memory marked as <em class="italic">in use</em> but no longer accessible by a pointer. While Java still required you to allocate memory, you did not need to deallocate it. A process called the <strong class="bold">garbage collector</strong> tracked <a id="_idIndexMarker018"/>all memory allocations. When a pointer, named a reference in Java, went out of scope, the garbage collector would release its memory automatically. There are five garbage collectors available. The Parallel Garbage Collector<a id="_idIndexMarker019"/> is the default general-purpose collector. Serial<a id="_idIndexMarker020"/> Garbage Collector, CMS Garbage<a id="_idIndexMarker021"/> Collector, G1 Garbage <a id="_idIndexMarker022"/>Collector, and Z Garbage Collector<a id="_idIndexMarker023"/> use algorithms for specific types of applications such as those requiring low latency or requiring only a single thread.</p>
			<p>However, garbage collection is not the most significant feature of Java. What sets Java apart from its <a id="_idIndexMarker024"/>predecessors, <strong class="bold">C</strong> and <strong class="bold">C++</strong>, is that Java programs do not execute directly<a id="_idIndexMarker025"/> in the computer’s <a id="_idIndexMarker026"/>operating system. Instead, compiled Java programs, called <strong class="bold">bytecode</strong>, execute<a id="_idIndexMarker027"/> inside another process called the <strong class="bold">Java virtual machine</strong> (<strong class="bold">JVM</strong>). </p>
			<p>The JVM is a software simulation of a computer. The bytecode is the machine language of this simulated machine. The JVM then translates the bytecode into the machine language of the underlying computer. </p>
			<p>The JVM is responsible for optimizing the code and performing garbage collection.</p>
			<p>Native languages such as C and C++ are directly compiled into the machine language of the CPU coupled with the computer’s operating system it will run on. Any libraries used must also have been compiled for a specific CPU and operating system. This means that a program compiled for an Intel CPU running Windows or an Apple M1 CPU running a specific version of macOS must be recompiled for an Intel CPU running Linux.</p>
			<p>Java turns this concept on its head. Code that you write in Java and compile into bytecode can run on any hardware and operating system unchanged if there is a JVM for that computer. Java describes itself as a <em class="italic">Write Once Run Anywhere</em> language. This means that a Java application written on and for an Intel CPU will also run on an ARM-based system unchanged and without the need to recompile if there is a JVM for that platform.</p>
			<p>In <a href="B19088_04.xhtml#_idTextAnchor086"><em class="italic">Chapter 4</em></a>, <em class="italic">Language Fundamentals – Data Types and Variables</em>, and <a href="B19088_05.xhtml#_idTextAnchor106"><em class="italic">Chapter 5</em></a><em class="italic">, Language Fundamentals – Classes</em>, we <a id="_idIndexMarker028"/>will examine the syntax of the Java language.</p>
			<p>Java is not the only language that runs in the JVM. More languages were developed to take advantage of the JVM while at the same time taking a different approach and syntax from Java. Here are four of the most widely used ones:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Scala</li>
				<li>Kotlin</li>
				<li>Groovy</li>
				<li>Clojure</li>
			</ul>
			<p>We now know what<a id="_idIndexMarker029"/> makes Java special in relation to languages that do not have a virtual machine. What can be confusing is that there is not just one version of Java distributed by just one company. Why? Let's take a look at that next.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-22"><a id="_idTextAnchor023"/>Why are there many distributions of Java?</h1>
			<p>Java<a id="_idIndexMarker030"/> was first released as proprietary software. In 2006, Sun Microsystems created an open source version of Java called the <strong class="bold">OpenJDK</strong> with a <a id="_idIndexMarker031"/>GNU General Public License allowing developers to change and share the program. Sun (and later, the new owner, Oracle) retained Java-related intellectual property and copyrights. </p>
			<p>One way to describe Java is to state that only JDKs and runtimes are considered Java if they pass an extensive suite of tests called the <strong class="bold">Technology Compatibility Kit </strong>(<strong class="bold">TCK</strong>). While<a id="_idIndexMarker032"/> Java was designated open source, initially, TCK was not. It needed to be licensed, for a fee, from Oracle. This resulted in very few companies making their own branded version of Java. </p>
			<p>Today, however, it is possible to get access to the TCK without paying a fee. You have to make a formal request to Oracle, along with presenting several supporting documents explaining why you require access to the TCK. A screening committee will review your request and decide whether to grant you access to the TCK. At the time of writing, 27 organizations have signed the <strong class="bold">OpenJDK Community TCK License Agreement</strong> (<strong class="bold">OCTLA</strong>) and <a id="_idIndexMarker033"/>have access to the TCK.</p>
			<p>So, why do companies still distribute their own branded version of Java? The simplest answer is to provide support to clients who wish to use Java in situations where the distributor may have more experience in a particular domain. Cloud providers such as Microsoft and Amazon have their own branded versions of Java that have been optimized for their cloud infrastructure. BellSoft, the distributor of the Liberica distribution, is one of the leaders involved in ARM versions of Java. While it might not make much of a difference which distribution you choose, the distribution your clients will use is significant. </p>
			<p>Regardless <a id="_idIndexMarker034"/>of the distributor, the language is maintained by Oracle. A well-established process allows anyone to propose changes to the language. Through <a id="_idIndexMarker035"/>the <strong class="bold">Java Community Process</strong> (<strong class="bold">JCP</strong>), all changes, additions, and removals from the language are carefully reviewed. </p>
			<p>The actual coding of changes to the JDK is primarily the responsibility of developers working for Oracle. Consider joining the JCP to keep abreast of changes and contribute to the language.</p>
			<p>Let's move on and look at which version you should use since you do not hav<a id="_idTextAnchor024"/>e any experience with the language.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-23"><a id="_idTextAnchor025"/>Which Java should you get?</h1>
			<p>All distributions of <a id="_idIndexMarker036"/>Java since Java 11, including Oracle’s distribution, are based on the OpenJDK source code. It should not matter whose distribution of Java you choose if it has passed the TCK. If you do not have a distribution you must use, then I recommend the Eclipse Adoptium version<a id="_idIndexMarker037"/> called <strong class="bold">Temurin</strong>. This version has passed the TCK. Java is a registered trademark, so the word cannot be used for distributions other than from Oracle, hence the name Temurin. If you are curious about where this name came from, I will give you a hint – it is an anagram.</p>
			<p>You might think that the obvious choice for a Java distribution would be an Oracle-branded version. This was pretty much the case until the final release of Java 8. With this release, Oracle required companies that distributed Java as part of their commercial offerings to purchase a commercial support license for access to updates to Java. Starting with Java 11, Oracle required commercial licensees to purchase a subscription for every developer. Personal use of the Oracle-branded JDK has remained free to use, though.</p>
			<p>This gets confusing because should you choose to use the OpenJDK distribution or any other distribution based on the OpenJDK except for Oracle’s, there are no fees required for commercial distribution. With the release of Java 17, Oracle changed its licensing again. Now called the Oracle <strong class="bold">No-Fee Terms and Conditions</strong> (<strong class="bold">NFTC</strong>), this now allows you to use Oracle’s Java <a id="_idIndexMarker038"/>for the development of software and then distribute this version of Java with your program without the need for a subscription or fee. This is only applicable to versions of Java starting at 17. Versions from 8 to 16 are still subject to the licenses.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-24"><a id="_idTextAnchor026"/>How is Java licensed?</h2>
			<p>If you plan to <a id="_idIndexMarker039"/>use Java to develop software commercially, then how it is licensed is important to you. As already stated, the OpenJDK carries the GNU General Public License version 2, commonly referred<a id="_idIndexMarker040"/> to as the <strong class="bold">GPLv2</strong>. The GPL is widely used in open source software. At its most basic level, it requires any software that uses GPL licensed code to also be subject to the GPL. This means that any software you create must make its source code available under the same conditions. Copyright and intellectual property rights stay with the author of the work, either Oracle or you.</p>
			<p>Java’s GPLv2 carries with it the Classpath Exception, also called the <a id="_idIndexMarker041"/>linking exception. A classpath, like <a id="_idIndexMarker042"/>an operating system path, is the location of classes and packages that the JVM and Java compiler will use. Under this exception, you do not need to supply the source code when you distribute your application. The software you write that is linked to Java does not require a GPLv2 license. It can remain proprietary and cannot be freely used like GPL software. You choose the licensing for the code that you generate.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-25"><a id="_idTextAnchor027"/>Why are there so many versions of Java?</h1>
			<p>Java is constantly evolving – bug fixes, enhancements, and new features are in continuous development. Java was initially numbered as 1 plus a version number. The first nine versions starting in 1996 and until 2014 were 1.0, 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 1.5, 1.6, 1.7, and 1.8. Between each of these <a id="_idIndexMarker043"/>versions, there was a third number that represented an update rather than a major revision, such as 1.8_202. </p>
			<p>Starting with Java 1.8, then subsequently named Java 8, here is the timeline of Java versions:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer008" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B19088_01_Table1.jpg" alt=""/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Figure">Table 1.1 – Timeline of Java versions</p>
			<p>You will<a id="_idIndexMarker044"/> see several versions designated <strong class="bold">LTS</strong>, short for <strong class="bold">Long Term Support</strong>, by Oracle. These <a id="_idIndexMarker045"/>versions are expected to be supported with bug fixes and security updates for at least 8 years. The non-LTS versions, also called <strong class="bold">feature releases</strong>, are<a id="_idIndexMarker046"/> accumulative fixes, updates, and preview features. Support for these versions is expected to last only until the next non-LTS or LTS version is released. Companies that have their own Java distribution may provide support for longer than Oracle does. </p>
			<p>LTS versions are typically what many organizations prefer to use for their products. Java 8, released in March 2014, is still supported and will be until December 2030. Subsequent LTS versions are being supported for just 8 years but, as already mentioned, may be supported by other Java distributors for a longer period. The current schedule for new releases of Java has an LTS version every 2 years. A non-LTS version is released every 6 months. </p>
			<p>If you plan to develop server-side software, you must use an LTS version. Libraries required for server-side are written to use a specific LTS version. When a new LTS version is released, it might take some time for all such libraries to be updated as is currently the case with LTS Java 17. As I write this, most server-side applications are running Java 11 and some still even use Java 8.</p>
			<p>What has contributed to Java’s success is evident in the continuing and now regular cadence of releases. This ensures that Java continues to be a state-of-the-art language.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-26"><a id="_idTextAnchor028"/>Installing Java</h1>
			<p>Installing <a id="_idIndexMarker047"/>Java is a simple process. As a developer, you will install the JDK from any of the distributors. Most Java distributors have packaged Java with an installer and as a compressed file without an installer that you can download. The choice depends on your OS, CPU, and whether you are the administrator or superuser and can use an installer. Or, you are a client and can only install the compressed file.</p>
			<p>With your distribution and version decided, you are ready to install Java as an admin and non-adm<a id="_idTextAnchor029"/>in.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-27"><a id="_idTextAnchor030"/>As an admin</h2>
			<p>As an admin, you can install Java for all users of the computer in the following ways.</p>
			<h4>Windows</h4>
			<p>Download the<a id="_idIndexMarker048"/> appropriate (32- or 64-bit) <strong class="source-inline">.msi</strong> file for Java from <a href="https://adoptium.net/">https://adoptium.net/</a>. This type of file contains an installer that will place Java in the folder of your choice and configure the appropriate environment variables. Just double-click on the <strong class="source-inline">.msi</strong> file after it is downloaded. The Windows installer will lead you through the installation.</p>
			<h4>macOS</h4>
			<p>You have two options <a id="_idIndexMarker049"/>for installing Java for macOS. The first is to download the <strong class="source-inline">.pkg</strong> file for Mac that includes an installer. Just double-click on the <strong class="source-inline">.pkg</strong> file after it is downloaded. The Apple installer will lead you through the installation.</p>
			<p>The second is to<a id="_idIndexMarker050"/> use <strong class="bold">HomeBrew</strong>, a command-line utility for managing new software and updates, which will download and install Java.</p>
			<p>With HomeBrew installed, you can install the OpenJDK version with the following:</p>
			<pre class="console">
brew install openjdk@17 </pre>
			<p>To install the Eclipse Temurin version of Java 17, use the following:</p>
			<pre class="console">
brew tap homebrew/cask-versions
brew install --cask temurin17</pre>
			<h4>Linux</h4>
			<p>On <a id="_idIndexMarker051"/>Linux, you use the <strong class="source-inline">apt install</strong> command-line tool. You must be a superuser/admin to use this tool. You also include the distribution and version you require. You install the OpenJDK Java at the command line with the following:</p>
			<pre class="console">
sudo apt install openjdk-17-jdk</pre>
			<p>To install the Eclipse Temurin version of Java, use the following:</p>
			<pre class="console">
sudo apt install temurin-17-jdk</pre>
			<h3>Verifying installation</h3>
			<p>Once the <a id="_idIndexMarker052"/>installation is complete, verify that Java works by issuing the following command: </p>
			<pre class="console">
java -version</pre>
			<p>If it shows you the version and distribution name of Java that you just installed, you are done and ready to code Java. The version number may be different depending on when you download Java or use <strong class="source-inline">apt install</strong>. Here is what you should see:</p>
			<h4>Windows</h4>
			<pre class="console">
&gt;java -version
openjdk version "17.0.3" 2022-04-19
OpenJDK Runtime Environment Temurin-17.0.3+7 (build 17.0.3+7)
OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM Temurin-17.0.3+7 (build 17.0.3+7, mixed mode, 
    sharing)</pre>
			<h4>Linux and macOS</h4>
			<pre class="console">
$ java -version
openjdk version "17.0.3" 2022-04-19
OpenJDK Runtime Environment Temurin-17.0.3+7 (build 17.0.3+7)
OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM Temurin-17.0.3+7 (build 17.0.3+7, mixed mode, 
    sharing)</pre>
			<p>If it tells<a id="_idIndexMarker053"/> you that it cannot find Java, then follow the instructions given in the coming <em class="italic">Configuring environment variables</em> section for setting up the environment variables.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-28"><a id="_idTextAnchor031"/>As a non-admin</h2>
			<p>If you are not an admin, then you can still install Java but only you will be able to use it.</p>
			<h4>Windows</h4>
			<p>Windows<a id="_idIndexMarker054"/> users can download the appropriate <strong class="source-inline">.zip</strong> file version and unzip it in the desired folder.</p>
			<h4>Linux and macOS</h4>
			<p>Download <a id="_idIndexMarker055"/>the appropriate <strong class="source-inline">.tar.gz</strong> file version for either<a id="_idIndexMarker056"/> Linux or macOS. Once downloaded, use the following command line. The only difference between Linux and macOS is the name of the file.</p>
			<p>For Linux, use the following: </p>
			<pre class="console">
tar xzf OpenJDK17U-jdk_x64_linux_hotspot_17.0.3_7.tar.gz</pre>
			<p>For macOS, use the following: </p>
			<pre class="console">
 tar xzf OpenJDK17U-jdk_x64_mac_hotspot_17.0<a id="_idTextAnchor032"/>.3_7.tar.gz </pre>
			<h3>Configuring environment variables </h3>
			<p>There are<a id="_idIndexMarker057"/> two environment variables that need to be set. While the environment variables are the same on Windows, Linux, and macOS, the process of setting them differs.</p>
			<p>The first environment variable is <strong class="source-inline">JAVA_HOME</strong>. Certain Java processes, such as web servers, need to know where Java is installed to be able to access specific components in the JDK. It must be assigned the full path to the folder in which you have installed Java.</p>
			<p>The second environment variable is <strong class="source-inline">PATH</strong>. When a program is run from the command line, the OS will look for an executable file in the current directory. If it is not found, then it will go through every directory in the path to look for it.</p>
			<p>You will have to enter these commands every time you open a console. Adjust the command based on your login name and the version of Java you are installing. While you can install multiple versions of Java, only one can be used for <strong class="source-inline">JAVA_HOME</strong> and <strong class="source-inline">PATH</strong>: </p>
			<h4>Windows</h4>
			<pre class="console">
set JAVA_HOME= C:\devapp\jdk-17.0.2+8
set PATH=%JAVA_HOME%\bin;%PATH%</pre>
			<p>Adjust the <a id="_idIndexMarker058"/>path to the folder created when you unzipped the Java file. You can also place these two lines in a batch file that you can run every time you open a console to code in Java:</p>
			<h4>Linux</h4>
			<pre class="console">
export JAVA_HOME=/home/javadev/java/jdk-17.0.2+8
export PATH=$JAVA_HOME/bin:$PATH</pre>
			<p>This assumes<a id="_idIndexMarker059"/> that you are logged in as <strong class="source-inline">javadev</strong> and you are placing Java in a directory called <strong class="source-inline">java</strong>. These two lines can be added to your <strong class="source-inline">.profile</strong> file in your home directory so that they execute every time you log in.</p>
			<h4>macOS</h4>
			<pre class="console">
export JAVA_HOME=/Users/javadev/java/jdk-17.03+7/Contents/Home
export PATH=$JAVA_HOME/bin:$PATH</pre>
			<p>This<a id="_idIndexMarker060"/> assumes that you are logged in as <strong class="source-inline">javadev</strong> and you are placing Java in a directory called <strong class="source-inline">java</strong>. These two lines can be added to your <strong class="source-inline">.bash.profile</strong> file in your home directory so that they execute every time you log in.</p>
			<h3>Verifying installation</h3>
			<p>You <a id="_idIndexMarker061"/>can quickly determine whether your installation of Java is correct. Open a command or console window on whatever system you are using. If you performed the non-admin installation, then ensure that <strong class="source-inline">JAVA_HOME</strong> and <strong class="source-inline">PATH</strong> have been updated and set. In the command window, enter the following:</p>
			<pre class="console">
java -version</pre>
			<p>If the installation was successful, the output, if you installed the OpenJDK, will be as follows:</p>
			<pre class="console">
openjdk version "17.0.3" 2022-04-19
OpenJDK Runtime Environment (build 17.0.3+7-Ubuntu-0ubuntu0.20.04.1)
OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM (build 17.0.3+7-Ubuntu-0ubuntu0.20.04.1, mixed mode, sharing)</pre>
			<p>The output, if you installed the Temurin JDK, will be as follows:</p>
			<pre class="console">
openjdk version "17.0.3" 2022-04-19
OpenJDK Runtime Environment Temurin-17.0.3+7 (build 17.0.3+7)

    sharing)</pre>
			<p>Your installation is now complete and verified. Let's now examine some of the files that you just installed. </p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-29"><a id="_idTextAnchor033"/>What is in the box?</h1>
			<p>The JDK<a id="_idIndexMarker062"/> contains the programs and libraries necessary to compile your source code into bytecode and then execute your code in the JVM program. It also includes numerous tools that support your work as a developer.</p>
			<p>There is a second packaging of <a id="_idIndexMarker063"/>Java, called the <strong class="bold">Java Runtime Edition</strong> (<strong class="bold">JRE</strong>). This smaller package only contains the components necessary to run Java bytecode and not the Java compiler. </p>
			<p>Java 9 introduced a new way to package Java applications that rendered the JRE superfluous. As of Java 11, Oracle no longer distributes a JRE for both their distribution and the OpenJDK. Certain distributions from other companies may still provide a JRE for the current versions of Java. We will look at the modular approach to packaging Java applications in a later chapter.</p>
			<p>The installation of Java will take up approximately 300 MB of disk space depending on the underlying OS. </p>
			<p>The following are the directory structures from a Linux and Windows Java installation. The first is for Ubuntu but will be almost identical on all Linux and macOS installations. </p>
			<p>The directory structure<a id="_idIndexMarker064"/> for Ubuntu 20.04.4 LTS is as follows:</p>

			<p>If we investigate the <strong class="source-inline">bin</strong> folder, we will find several executable programs that Java refers to as its tools. On a Windows system, they all have the <strong class="source-inline">.exe</strong> extension; on Linux and macOS, they appear as names only. In this chapter, we will discuss the following tools: </p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="source-inline">jar</strong></li>
				<li><strong class="source-inline">java</strong></li>
				<li><strong class="source-inline">javadoc</strong></li>
				<li><strong class="source-inline">jlink</strong></li>
				<li><strong class="source-inline">jmod</strong></li>
				<li><strong class="source-inline">jpackage</strong></li>
				<li><strong class="source-inline">jshell</strong></li>
				<li><strong class="source-inline">javaw</strong></li>
			</ul>
			<p>These are tools we will be using in the coming chapters. See the tool specification link in the <em class="italic">Further reading</em> section for details on all the tools included in the JDK. </p>
			<p>We have divided these tools into the following categories:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Compiling and executing a Java program</li>
				<li>Assembling and packaging a Java application</li>
				<li>Documenting Java classes</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Read, Evaluate, Print, and Loop</strong> (<strong class="bold">REPL</strong>)</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Let’s look at each<a id="_idTextAnchor034"/> of these categories.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-30"><a id="_idTextAnchor035"/>Compiling and executing a Java program </h2>
			<p>These <a id="_idIndexMarker066"/>are the tools that take us from source code to running a Java program. Some<a id="_idIndexMarker067"/> important tools are as follows.</p>
			<h3>javac</h3>
			<p>This is the <a id="_idIndexMarker068"/>Java compiler. Its role is to compile a Java source code file that ends in <strong class="source-inline">.java</strong> into a bytecode file that ends in <strong class="source-inline">.class</strong>. </p>
			<h3>java or javaw.exe</h3>
			<p>This is the tool that starts up the JVM process and then executes the bytecode file in the process. When using <strong class="source-inline">java</strong>, a console window will open and remain open until the JVM process ends. The <strong class="source-inline">javaw</strong> tool also<a id="_idIndexMarker069"/> starts up the JVM and executes a bytecode program. It will not open a console. </p>
			<p>Windows users typically do not expect a console to open as they may have never seen one or interacted with one. If you wish to create a Windows shortcut to run a Java program, you will<a id="_idIndexMarker070"/> use <strong class="source-inline">javaw.exe program.class</strong>.</p>
			<p>We will examine these three commands in <a href="B19088_02.xhtml#_idTextAnchor043"><em class="italic">Chapter 2</em></a>, <em class="italic">Code, Compile, and Execute</em>.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-31"><a id="_idTextAnchor036"/>Assembling and packaging a Java application</h2>
			<p>A<a id="_idIndexMarker071"/> Java program can be constructed of hundreds, thousands, or <a id="_idIndexMarker072"/>even more <strong class="source-inline">.class</strong> files. In these cases, it is necessary to assemble all these files along with any supporting files (such as images) into a single file. Some of the tools that do so are the following.</p>
			<h3>jar</h3>
			<p>A Java program or library usually consists of multiple <strong class="source-inline">.class</strong> files. To simplify the delivery of such programs, the <strong class="source-inline">jar</strong> tool combines all the class files of an application or library into a single file that <a id="_idIndexMarker073"/>uses ZIP compression and has the <strong class="source-inline">.jar</strong> extension. A <strong class="source-inline">.jar</strong> file can be designated as executable. In this case, you already have a Java JDK or JRE installed. We will see how this tool is used in <a href="B19088_02.xhtml#_idTextAnchor043"><em class="italic">Chapter 2</em></a>,<em class="italic">Code, Compile, and Execute</em>.</p>
			<h3>jmod and jlink</h3>
			<p>Java 9 introduced the concept of modular Java, an approach to assembling Java applications that uses a new format for combining class files called <strong class="source-inline">.jmod</strong> files. These files are like <strong class="source-inline">.jar</strong> files in that they are <a id="_idIndexMarker074"/>ZIP compressed files. The <strong class="source-inline">jmod</strong> tool creates <strong class="source-inline">.jmod</strong> files. </p>
			<p>Until Java 9 came <a id="_idIndexMarker075"/>along, a single file called <strong class="source-inline">rt.jar</strong> held all the Java libraries. Starting with Java 9, the Java libraries exist as individual <strong class="source-inline">.jmod</strong> files. Java packages the JVM file as a <strong class="source-inline">.jmod</strong> file. What this means to a developer is that it is possible to distribute Java applications that include the JVM and only those components of Java that must be available to execute your program. It is now unnecessary to have the JDK or JRE pre-installed as all that you need to execute the program is in the archive. You still need the <strong class="source-inline">jar</strong> tool to construct such an executable as you cannot execute <strong class="source-inline">.jmod</strong> files. We will see how these two tools are used in <a href="B19088_16.xhtml#_idTextAnchor315"><em class="italic">Chapter 16</em></a>, <em class="italic">Deploying Java in Standalone Packages and Containers</em>.</p>
			<h3>jpackage</h3>
			<p>The <strong class="source-inline">jpackage</strong> tool<a id="_idIndexMarker076"/> creates native applications that hold a Java application and a Java runtime. It is used with either <strong class="source-inline">.jar</strong> or <strong class="source-inline">.jmod</strong> files. The output is an executable file, such as <strong class="source-inline">.msi</strong> or <strong class="source-inline">.exe</strong> for Windows, or a <strong class="source-inline">.dmg</strong> file for a macOS system. We will see how <a id="_idTextAnchor037"/>this tool is used in <a href="B19088_16.xhtml#_idTextAnchor315"><em class="italic">Chapter 16</em></a><em class="italic">, </em><em class="italic">Deploying Java in Standalone Packages and Containers</em>.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-32"><a id="_idTextAnchor038"/>Documenting Java classes</h2>
			<p>Having carefully<a id="_idIndexMarker077"/> documented your code, Java has a tool for gathering all your comments for easy access for other developers who may use your code. </p>
			<h3>javadoc</h3>
			<p>Documenting code has always been an issue in almost every language. Java takes a unique approach to encouraging documentation. If you comment your code in a specific format (which we will examine in <a href="B19088_04.xhtml#_idTextAnchor086"><em class="italic">Chapter 4</em></a>, <em class="italic">Language Fundamentals – Data Types and Variables</em>), the <strong class="source-inline">javadoc</strong> tool will generate an HTML page for<a id="_idIndexMarker078"/> every class that you create. On this page, you will find all public members of the class presented. </p>
			<p>Look<a id="_idIndexMarker079"/> at the <strong class="source-inline">javadoc</strong> page for the <strong class="source-inline">ArrayList</strong> class at https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.base/java/util/ArrayList.html. Everything you see on this web page was written into the source code file that was then converted to the HTML page you are looking at. We w<a id="_idTextAnchor039"/>ill examine this tool in <a href="B19088_11.xhtml#_idTextAnchor232"><em class="italic">Chapter 11</em></a><em class="italic">, </em><em class="italic">Documentation and Logging</em>.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-33"><a id="_idTextAnchor040"/>REPL </h2>
			<p>A REPL tool<a id="_idIndexMarker080"/> is one that supports the execution of code, one line at a time.</p>
			<h3>jshell</h3>
			<p>The <strong class="source-inline">jshell</strong> tool<a id="_idIndexMarker081"/> allows you to write and execute individual Java statements without the need for the usual decorations of classes and methods. This can be quite useful for learning Java. It can execute code line by line as you write it. We will examine <strong class="source-inline">jshell</strong> in <a href="B19088_02.xhtml#_idTextAnchor043"><em class="italic">Chapter 2</em></a><em class="italic">, </em><em class="italic">Code, Compile, and Execute</em>.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-34"><a id="_idTextAnchor041"/>Summary</h1>
			<p>In this chapter, we have learned a little about Java’s history, how it is licensed, and why there are so many distributions and versions of Java. You now understand Java as a development tool and know how to select a Java distribution and version. We saw how we could install Java on our computers regardless of the OS. In <a href="B19088_12.xhtml#_idTextAnchor244"><em class="italic">Chapter 12</em></a>, <em class="italic">BigDecimal and Unit Testing</em>, we will also examine how to install Java in a Docker container. We wrapped up the chapter with a look at nine Java tools that come with the JDK; we will see them again in later chapters. We will learn more about these tools in those chapters.</p>
			<p>In <a href="B19088_02.xhtml#_idTextAnchor043"><em class="italic">Chapter 2</em></a>, <em class="italic">Code, Compile, and Execute</em>, we will learn how we write, compile, link, and execute Java programs. Coding with a plain text editor, <strong class="source-inline">jshell</strong>, and with an <strong class="bold">integrated development environment</strong> (<strong class="bold">IDE</strong>) will be our focus.</p>
