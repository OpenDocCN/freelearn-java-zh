- en: If you have picked up this book, you care about the architecture of the software
    you’re building. You want your software to not only fulfill the customer’s explicit
    requirements but also the hidden requirement of maintainability, and your own
    requirements concerning structure and aesthetics.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It’s hard to fulfill these requirements because software projects (or projects
    in general, for that matter) usually don’t go as planned. Managers draw deadlines
    all around the project team[1](#footnote-003), external partners build their APIs
    differently from what they had promised, and the software products we depend on
    don’t work as expected.
  prefs: []

- en: '[1](#footnote-003-backlink) The word “deadline” presumably originates from
    the 19th century and described a line drawn around a prison or a camp of prisoners.
    A prisoner that crossed that line was shot. Think about this definition the next
    time someone “draws a deadline” around you... it will certainly open up new perspectives.
    See [https://www.merriam-webster.com/words-at-play/your-deadline-wont-kill-you](https://www.merriam-webster.com/words-at-play/your-deadline-wont-kill-you).'

- en: And then there is our own software architecture. It was so nice in the beginning.
    Everything was clear and beautiful. Then the deadlines pressed us into taking
    shortcuts. Now, the shortcuts are all that’s left of the architecture, and it
    takes longer and longer to deliver new features.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Our shortcut-driven architecture makes it hard to react to an API that had to
    be changed because an external partner screwed up. It seems easier to just send
    our project manager into battle with that partner to tell them to deliver the
    API we had agreed upon.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Instead of letting external factors govern the state of our software architecture,
    this book takes the stance of taking control ourselves. We gain this control by
    creating an architecture that makes the software soft, as in “flexible,” “extensible,”
    and “adaptable.” Such an architecture will make it easy to react to external factors
    and take a lot of pressure off our backs.

- en: The goal of this book
  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I wrote this book because I was disappointed with the practicality of the resources
    available on domain-centric architecture styles, such as Robert C. Martin’s *Clean
    Architecture* and Alistair Cockburn’s *Hexagonal Architecture*.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Many books and online resources explain valuable concepts but not how we can
    actually implement them.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: That’s probably because there is more than one way to implement any architecture
    style.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: With this book, I am trying to fill this void by providing a hands-on-code discussion
    about creating a web application in the Hexagonal Architecture or “Ports and Adapters”
    style. In order to live up to that goal, the code examples and concepts discussed
    in this book provide my interpretation of how to implement a Hexagonal Architecture.
    There are certainly other interpretations out there, and I do not claim that mine
    is authoritative.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I certainly hope, however, that you will get some inspiration from the concepts
    in this book so that you can create your own interpretation of Hexagonal/Clean
    Architecture.

- en: Who this book is for
  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This book is aimed at software developers of all experience levels involved
    in creating web applications. As a junior developer, you’ll learn about how to
    design software components and complete applications in a clean and maintainable
    manner. You will also learn some arguments for when to apply a certain technique.
    You should, however, have participated in building a web application in the past
    to get the most out of this book. If you’re an experienced developer, you’ll enjoy
    comparing the concepts from the book with your own way of doing things and, hopefully,
    incorporating bits and pieces into your own software development style. The code
    examples in this book are in Java and Kotlin, but all discussions are equally
    applicable to other object-oriented programming languages. If you’re not a Java
    programmer but can read object-oriented code in other languages, you’ll be fine.
    In the few places where we need some Java or framework specifics, I will explain
    them.

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To have a recurrent theme throughout the book, most of the code examples show
    code from an example web application for transferring money online. We’ll call
    it “BuckPal.”[2](#footnote-002)

- en: '[2](#footnote-002-backlink) BuckPal: a quick online search has revealed that
    a company named PayPal has stolen my idea and even copied part of the name. Joking
    aside: try to find a name similar to “PayPal” that is not the name of an existing
    company. It’s hilarious!'

- en: The curse of example applications for software engineering books and online
    resources is that they’re too simple to highlight the real-world problems we struggle
    with every day. On the other hand, an example application must stay simple enough
    to effectively convey the discussed concepts.

    discuss the use cases of the BuckPal application throughout this book.
