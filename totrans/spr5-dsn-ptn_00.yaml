- en: Spring 5 Design Patterns is for all Java developers who want to learn Spring
    for the enterprise application. Therefore, enterprise Java developers will find
    it particularly useful in the understanding of design patterns used by the Spring
    Framework and how it solves common design problems in the enterprise application,
    and they will fully appreciate the examples presented in this book. Before reading
    this book, readers should have basic knowledge of Core Java, JSP, Servlet, and
    XML.

- en: Spring 5 Framework is newly launched by Pivotal with reactive programming. Spring
    5 introduces many new features and enhancements from its previous version. We
    will discuss all this in the book. *Spring 5 Design Patterns* will give you in-depth
    insight about the Spring Framework.

- en: The great part of today's Spring Framework is that all companies have already
    taken it as a primary framework for development of the enterprise application.
    For Spring, no external enterprise server is needed to start working with it.

- en: The goals of writing this book are to discuss all design patterns used behind
    the Spring Framework and how they are implemented in the Spring Framework. Here,
    the author has also given you some best practices that must be used in the design
    and development of the application.

- en: Spring 5 Design Patterns is divided into three sections. The first section introduces
    you to the essentials of the design patterns and the Spring Framework. The second
    section steps behind the front end and shows where Spring fits in the back end
    of an application. The third section expands on this by showing how to build web
    applications with Spring and introducing a new feature of the Spring 5 reactive
    programming. This part also shows how to handle concurrency in the enterprise
    application.

- en: This book can be read without a computer or laptop at hand, in which case you
    need nothing more than the book itself. Although to follow the examples in the
    book, you need Java 8, which you can download from [http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html).
    You will also need your favorite IDE for the examples, but I have used the Software
    Spring Tool Suite; download the latest version of Spring Tool Suite (STS) from
    [https://spring.io/tools/sts/all](https://spring.io/tools/sts/all) according to
    your system OS. The Java 8 and STS work on a variety of platforms--Windows, macOS,
