<p class="mce-root">Java Enterprise Edition 8, the latest version of the Java EE specification, adds several new features to the specification. Several existing Java EE APIs have seen major improvements in this version of the specification, and some brand new APIs have been added to Java EE. This book covers the latest versions of the most popular Java EE specifications, including JavaServer Faces (JSF), the Java Persistence API (JPA), Enterprise JavaBeans (EJB), Contexts and Dependency Injection (CDI), the Java API for JSON Processing (JSON-P), the new Java API for JSON Binding (JSON-B), the Java API for WebSocket, the Java Messaging Service (JMS) API 2.0, the Java API for XML Web Services (JAX-WS), and the Java API for RESTful Web Services (JAX-RS). It also covers securing Java EE applications via the brand new Java EE 8 Security API.</p>

<p>In this book, you will find a number of text styles that distinguish between different kinds of information. Here are some examples of these styles and an explanation of their meaning.</p>
<p>Code words in<span> </span>text, database table names, folder names, filenames, file extensions, pathnames, dummy URLs, user input, and Twitter handles are shown as follows: "The <kbd>@Named</kbd> class annotation designates this bean as a CDI named bean."</p>
<p>A block of code is set as follows:</p>
<pre style="padding-left: 60px">if (!emailValidator.isValid(email)) {<br/>  FacesMessage facesMessage = <br/>       new FacesMessage(htmlInputText.getLabel()<br/>      + ": email format is not valid");<br/>  throw new ValidatorException(facesMessage);<br/>      }</pre>
<p class="mce-root">When we wish to draw your attention to a particular part of a code block, the relevant lines or items are set in bold:</p>
<pre class="CodeHighlightedPACKT"><strong>@FacesValidator(value = "emailValidator")</strong></pre>
<p><span>Any command-line input or output is written as follows:</span></p>
<pre class="CommandLinePACKT"><strong>/asadmin start-domain domain1</strong></pre>
<p><strong>New terms</strong><span> </span>and<span> </span><strong>important words</strong><span> </span>are shown in bold. Words that you see on the screen, for example, in menus or dialog boxes, appear in the text like this: "Clicking the <span class="packt_screen">Next</span> button moves you to the next screen."</p>
<div class="packt_infobox">Warnings or important notes appear like this.</div>
<div class="packt_tip">Tips and tricks appear like this.</div>
