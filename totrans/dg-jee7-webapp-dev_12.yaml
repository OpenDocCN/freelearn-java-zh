    teams; but the practice of software development, design, and architecture is never
    a free ride. There is a real tangible cost to the building of good quality engineered
    solutions. We are the cost. It costs us our time, resources, and energy, and there
    is a never-ending demand for better performance, profit margins, and user friendliness.
    The performance in digital teams as in any other line of business depends heavily
    on good communication and the ability to play nice with others in our workplace.

    for a high-profile business or customer, you might find yourself under severe
    scrutiny so as to ensure that the project goes according to the plan. Meeting
    customer targets sometimes is at odds with an agile laissez-faire development.
    There are crucial times where the team has to pull together in order to deliver
    a product quickly and yet be well-balanced enough to allow technical decisions
    with their user stories to be self-organized by the team. Often digital teams
    can race ahead with little thought to the overall technical architecture, leading
    to an end state and final delivery that leaves the stakeholder frustrated and
    concerned. Agile is not a guarantee of the quality of a product, but it helps.

    responsibility to write the implementation of the product code for a digital application.
    I will go further that this role includes writing unit tests, functional tests

    the smartphone developers that write code with iOS, Android, and other platforms.
    Interface developers tend to be involved with the HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript coding.

    which is a controversial role according to the different points of view. At best,
    this role is a migratory and contentious role that ensures that the other software
    developers in the team are writing enough production code that is testable and
    verifiable. Therefore, this role requires an ability to develop the Java code;
    it may also require the JavaScript ability and automated tests. Due to the ramifications
    of the political outcome, whether Java and interface developers are writing enough
    quality tests such as unit tests, functional tests, and integration tests, it
    remains a loosely defined role. The role probably includes testing advocacy.

    information and knowledge from large data sets that may be structured or unstructured.

    the application meets certain **non-functional requirements**. A **non-functional**
    requirement is an aspect or feature of the target software that does not reflect
    on its functional operation. A functional operation for a caseworker is that the
    staff are allowed to process the cases in real time. **Non-functional requirements**
    (**NFRs**) are features or criteria that specify and describe the operation of
    a system's architecture. The operational features are known as adaptability, availability,
    flexibility, maintainability, performance, reusability, robustness, scalability,
    security, and testability. Usually, an architect has to trade off these non-functional
    requirements. For example, they consider availability versus performance and ask
    the business stakeholder which feature is more important or strike a compromise
    with the architecture.

    commercial terms and policies that ultimately affect the project. Therefore, a
    business analyst is the key to establishing the ubiquitous language with the stakeholders.

    the business stakeholders and vice versa. An analyst communicates widely with
