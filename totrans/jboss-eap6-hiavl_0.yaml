- en: High availability is a broad topic to discuss, and it concerns both project
    deployment and development. In this book, I'd like to explore the topics on clustering,
    load balancing, failover, and session replication.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: High availability is also a very interesting topic, and the technologies provided
    by open source communities are especially fun. In this book we'll learn how to
    use JBoss EAP6 together with other JBoss and Apache community tools to build a
    high-availability system.

- en: 'Here is a brief list of the projects we''ll use in this book: JBoss EAP 6,
    Apache httpd, mod_jk, and mod_cluster. When I''m writing this book, JBoss EAP
    6.1.0.Final is the newest product version based on JBoss AS 7.2.x and can be downloaded
    freely from the JBoss community. This version is very stable with its clustering
    features, so we''ll use it in our book.'

- en: Since AS 8.x, the project name of JBoss AS has been renamed to WildFly. Though
    the project name changed, its design hasn't changed much, and you can reuse most
    of the knowledge in this book for future versions of WildFly.

- en: JBoss EAP6 has provided a domain management feature that can help us to centralize
    the management of many servers. This feature is very helpful in a clustering environment,
    because we don't have to manage each server separately. We'll check this feature
    in the book.

    In this book, I'll introduce the methods of applying SSL into a clustering environment.

    to follow the shell commands shown in the book to configure the servers properly.

    many clustering features rely on IP multicasting, you can better understand the
    design of EAP6 clustering with this knowledge.

    some basic knowledge of EJB and Servlet development. In addition, some knowledge
    on Maven usage is preferred.

    and [Chapter 7](ch07.html "Chapter 7. Configuring mod_cluster with SSL"), *Configuring

    understanding of SSL/TLS technologies is needed if you want to follow the instructions

- en: When you are following the instructions in this book, please turn off the network
    firewall of your machine in case it blocks important ports needed by the cluster.
    If you are using Linux as your working environment, please disable SELinux because
    it will affect a lot on the clustering features. When you have fully understood
    the EAP6 clustering features, you can turn these protections back online and configure
    them properly to work with the EAP6 cluster.

    tutorial, so I've included some discussions on the design of JBoss EAP6 and relative
    projects.
