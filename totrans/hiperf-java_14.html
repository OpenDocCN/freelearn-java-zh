			<h1 id="_idParaDest-253"><a id="_idTextAnchor252"/>An introduction to profiling tools</h1>
			<p>Profiling tools <a id="_idIndexMarker713"/>play a critical role in performance tuning and proactive application enhancements to support high-performance <span class="No-Break">Java applications.</span></p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Profiling</p>
			<p class="callout">Profiling is the<a id="_idIndexMarker714"/> process of analyzing software at runtime with the goal of identifying performance issues, including bottlenecks, resource use, and <span class="No-Break">optimization opportunities.</span></p>
			<p>Once we build and test our software, it moves into production. This is where profiling occurs, during runtime. Using profiling tools, we can gain detailed insights into the runtime behavior of our applications. The goal is to have efficient code and our systems to perform optimally, including low latency, high reliability, and high availability. It is not enough for our applications to perform accurately; they also need to perform efficiently. The use of profiling tools allows us to pinpoint performance issues so we can further optimize <span class="No-Break">our code.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-254"><a id="_idTextAnchor253"/>The importance of profiling in performance tuning</h2>
			<p>Let’s<a id="_idIndexMarker715"/> look at five specific reasons that illustrate the importance of profiling to support <span class="No-Break">performance tuning:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Application responsiveness</strong>: At the heart of performance tuning is ensuring that our applications are responsive. Users should not be subjected to high latency. Profiling tools help us analyze how our resources are used, shedding light on opportunities <span class="No-Break">for improvement.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Bottlenecks</strong>: The use of profiling tools can help us identify performance bottlenecks and even potential bottlenecks. This allows us to take a proactive approach to performance tuning and helps us avoid catastrophic bottlenecks in <span class="No-Break">the future.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Continuous improvement</strong>: Software systems are not developed, deployed, and forgotten. We maintain our systems and strive to continually improve them. Systems that perform at desired levels today might underperform when a new operating system is released, or other environmental factors change. This requires a continuous improvement mindset. Continually profiling our applications and addressing optimization opportunities can help ensure our systems remain responsive <span class="No-Break">and efficient.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Resource utilization</strong>: The use of hardware resources such as CPU and memory should be closely monitored, as inefficient use of these resources can result in system lag and suboptimal input/output operations. Profiling tools can help us identify areas that can <span class="No-Break">be optimized.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Scalability</strong>: The larger our applications are, the more significant even a minor performance issue can be to overall system performance. The use of profiling tools helps us identify opportunities to enhance performance and address any related issues that could become more pronounced as our application scales, due to <span class="No-Break">increased demand.</span></li>
			</ul>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-255"><a id="_idTextAnchor254"/>Types of profiling tools and their uses</h2>
			<p>There are seven broad categories of profiling tools, each with its own focus area or purpose. Let’s review <span class="No-Break">those now:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">CPU profilers</strong>: This <a id="_idIndexMarker716"/>category of profiles analyzes an <a id="_idIndexMarker717"/>application’s CPU usage. They can identify specific methods in our applications that are the <span class="No-Break">most CPU-intensive.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">IDE embedded profilers</strong>: Most <a id="_idIndexMarker718"/>major IDEs (e.g., NetBeans, Eclipse, and IntelliJ IDEA) have<a id="_idIndexMarker719"/> built-in profiling tools. Because they are part of the IDE, they seamlessly integrate with the development environment. This makes them especially easy <span class="No-Break">to use.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Input/output profilers</strong>: These<a id="_idIndexMarker720"/> profilers specifically focus on our application’s input/output operations. If our input/output processes are slow or inefficient, these profilers can bring them to light so that we can refine operations such as file handling, database interactions, and <span class="No-Break">network communication.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Memory profilers</strong>: Memory profilers <a id="_idIndexMarker721"/>give us a window into memory allocation and memory use. This can help us identify actual or potential memory leaks and identify memory consumption optimization opportunities. We can use this category of profiler to provide insights into garbage collection, memory retention, and even object <span class="No-Break">life cycles.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Network profilers</strong>: As<a id="_idIndexMarker722"/> the name suggests, this category of profilers specializes in analyzing an application’s network communications. These profilers can help us identify latency issues and to understand how bandwidth is being used. Network profilers also help us identify suboptimal or inefficient <span class="No-Break">network protocols.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Specialized profilers</strong>: This is a <a id="_idIndexMarker723"/>category of profilers that provide tailored features for specific performance situations. They can also be used for specific environments (e.g., distributed systems or real-time systems) or <span class="No-Break">specific scenarios.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Thread profilers</strong>: Thread profilers <a id="_idIndexMarker724"/>monitor thread activity and are especially useful in multithreaded environments. This category of profiler helps us detect thread contention issues and potential deadlocks and identifies opportunities to optimize <span class="No-Break">thread management.</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>It is important to understand what profiling tools are and their categories and uses. This knowledge can help you select the most appropriate tool for your performance-related goals and <span class="No-Break">system requirements.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-256"><a id="_idTextAnchor255"/>Profilers bundled in the JDK</h1>
			<p>The JDK includes <a id="_idIndexMarker725"/>profiling tools that can provide us with valuable insights into our Java application’s performance. The use of these tools is highly recommended to identify performance issues and opportunities <a id="_idIndexMarker726"/>for performance fine-tuning. This section explores the primary profilers that are built-in to the JDK – JVisualVM and <strong class="bold">Java Mission </strong><span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">Control</strong></span><span class="No-Break"> (</span><span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">JMC</strong></span><span class="No-Break">).</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-257"><a id="_idTextAnchor256"/>JVisualVM</h2>
			<p>The <strong class="bold">JVisualVM</strong>, short for <strong class="bold">Java Visual Virtual Machine</strong>, is <a id="_idIndexMarker727"/>a robust profiling tool built into the JDK. It<a id="_idIndexMarker728"/> offers an impressive set of features that include monitoring, profiling, and troubleshooting <span class="No-Break">Java applications.</span></p>
			<h3>An overview and features</h3>
			<p>JVisualVM <a id="_idIndexMarker729"/>provides<a id="_idIndexMarker730"/> a graphical user interface that combines several JDK tools, including JConsole. The interface is displayed in the <span class="No-Break">following figure.</span></p>
			<div>
				<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer035">

				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 14.1: The JVisualVM graphical user interface</p>
			<p>The key <a id="_idIndexMarker731"/>features<a id="_idIndexMarker732"/> of JVisualVM are summarized <span class="No-Break">as follows:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Heap dump analysis</strong>: JVisualVM is able to capture heap dumps and analyze them for us. This can help us gain insight into memory use and identify real or potential <span class="No-Break">memory leaks.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Plugin integration</strong>: This tool’s functionality can be extended by a multitude of available plugins. The plugin repository is available via the Tools menu, open and displayed in the <span class="No-Break">following figure.</span></li>
			</ul>

			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 14.2: The JVisualVM plugin repository</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Monitoring</strong>: JVisualVM<a id="_idIndexMarker733"/> can monitor, in real time, our application’s memory<a id="_idIndexMarker734"/> consumption, garbage collection, thread activity, and <span class="No-Break">CPU usage.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Profiling</strong>: This tool offers the ability to conduct detailed profiling of CPU and memory use. This can help identify memory leaks <span class="No-Break">and bottlenecks.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Thread analysis</strong>: JVisualVM can be used to monitor and analyze our application’s thread states and <span class="No-Break">thread activities.</span></li>
			</ul>
			<h3>Use cases and examples</h3>
			<p>We can use JVisualVM<a id="_idIndexMarker735"/> for multiple use cases, and it is especially useful in the development, testing, and production phases. This tool provides us with detailed CPU and memory usage insights. We can use this tool to see which of our methods consumes the most CPU time. We can also look at memory consumption, object allocations, and garbage collection to help us optimize our application’s <span class="No-Break">memory use.</span></p>
			<p>As an<a id="_idIndexMarker736"/> example, consider a situation where we have a web application whose users report occasional lag. We can use JVisualVM to monitor our application’s CPU and memory use. This can help us identify spikes. From there, we can analyze thread dumps to determine the source of the problem. In this scenario, it could be as simple as a single Java method or thread that causes the occasional lag. Using the profiling tool can help us quickly get to the core of the issue so that we can refine our <span class="No-Break">code accordingly.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-258"><a id="_idTextAnchor257"/>JMC</h2>
			<p>JMC is <a id="_idIndexMarker737"/>another powerful JDK tool that we can use to profile and monitor <a id="_idIndexMarker738"/>our Java applications, most specifically in production environments. As you can see from the screenshot below, JMC includes the <strong class="bold">JMX Console</strong> and <span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">Flight Recorder</strong></span><span class="No-Break">.</span></p>
			<div>

				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 14.3: The JMC welcome screen</p>
			<h3>An overview and features</h3>
			<p>The <strong class="bold">Java Management Extensions</strong> (<strong class="bold">JMX</strong>) console is used to monitor and manage our<a id="_idIndexMarker739"/> Java<a id="_idIndexMarker740"/> applications. The <strong class="bold">Flight Recorder</strong> is<a id="_idIndexMarker741"/> for continuous<a id="_idIndexMarker742"/> monitoring and profiling. It collects detailed performance data, with limited impact on application performance. The events recorded <a id="_idIndexMarker743"/>include method invocations, memory allocation, thread activity, and input/output operations. The <strong class="bold">Java Flight Recorder</strong> (<strong class="bold">JFR</strong>) is<a id="_idIndexMarker744"/> the core component of JMC and can be used to record our running applications and then analyze the results, giving us insights into CPU usage, method-specific execution times, data on memory allocations, and <span class="No-Break">so on.</span></p>
			<p>Leveraging the capabilities of JMC and JVisualVM can result in deep insights into our application’s performance, empowering us to optimize our resource use and improve the responsiveness of our applications. In the next section, we will review profiling tools embedded <span class="No-Break">in IDEs.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-259"><a id="_idTextAnchor258"/>IDE-embedded profilers</h1>
			<p>Java developers use<a id="_idIndexMarker745"/> built-in profiling tools with their favorite IDEs. Using these profilers offers a convenient method of analyzing our software directly within our development environment of choice. This section explores the built-in capabilities of the IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, and <span class="No-Break">NetBeans IDEs.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-260"><a id="_idTextAnchor259"/>The IntelliJ IDEA profiler</h2>
			<p>The <strong class="bold">IntelliJ IDEA profiler</strong> allows<a id="_idIndexMarker746"/> us to profile our <a id="_idIndexMarker747"/>Java applications from within the IDE. This powerful feature is only available in the commercial edition of <a id="_idIndexMarker748"/>the IDE (<strong class="bold">IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate</strong>), so if you are using<a id="_idIndexMarker749"/> the <strong class="bold">Community Edition</strong> (<strong class="bold">CE</strong>), you will not be able to use the IntelliJ IDEA profiler. Integration and setup are simple; here are <span class="No-Break">the steps:</span></p>
			<ol>
				<li>Open <span class="No-Break">IntelliJ IDEA.</span></li>
				<li>Write or load your <span class="No-Break">Java project.</span></li>
				<li>Use the <strong class="bold">Run</strong> | <strong class="bold">Profile</strong> menu option to <span class="No-Break">start profiling.</span></li>
				<li>Select the type of profiling you want (CPU <span class="No-Break">or memory).</span></li>
			</ol>
			<p>With CPU profiling, the tool can identify methods in your code that consume the most CPU time. Call trees are also provided that show code paths and overall resource use (CPU and memory). The memory profiling capabilities of the IntelliJ IDEA Profiler include the ability to trace object allocations, analyze garbage collection efficacy, and detect <span class="No-Break">memory leaks.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-261"><a id="_idTextAnchor260"/>Eclipse’s Test and Performance Tools Platform</h2>
			<p>The <a id="_idIndexMarker750"/>Eclipse IDE is <a id="_idIndexMarker751"/>popular for Java developers, and it previously had an embedded profiling tool called the <strong class="bold">Test and Performance Tools Platform</strong> (<strong class="bold">TPTP</strong>). It was provided as a plugin, available from the Eclipse Marketplace. The key features included are <span class="No-Break">as follows:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><span class="No-Break">CPU profiling</span></li>
				<li><span class="No-Break">Memory profiling</span></li>
				<li><span class="No-Break">Thread analysis</span></li>
				<li><span class="No-Break">Input/output profiling</span></li>
				<li><span class="No-Break">Network activity</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>TPTP is mentioned here so that developers with Eclipse are not left wondering what embedded profiling tools Eclipse has. TPTP was archived, likely due to the increasing power of the JDK built-in <span class="No-Break">profiling tools.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-262"><a id="_idTextAnchor261"/>NetBeans Profiler</h2>
			<p>The <a id="_idIndexMarker752"/>NetBeans Profiler is integrated into the NetBeans IDE<a id="_idIndexMarker753"/> and has a top-level <strong class="bold">Profile</strong> menu item for easy configuration and access. The tool can conduct performance analysis in the categories of telemetry, methods, objects, threads, locks, and <span class="No-Break">SQL queries.</span></p>
			<p>The following screenshot shows the four main components of the tool’s dashboard when <strong class="bold">Telemetry profiling</strong> <span class="No-Break">is selected.</span></p>

			<p>Understanding <a id="_idIndexMarker755"/>the profiling tools that are integrated with your IDE can help you become more efficient with your time, as these integrated tools are the easiest to configure and use when compared to third-party tools, and in some cases, they are easier than using the profiling tools bundled with <span class="No-Break">the JDK.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-263"><a id="_idTextAnchor262"/>Additional profilers</h1>
			<p>So far, we <a id="_idIndexMarker756"/>have looked at profiling tools that are built-in to the JDK and ones embedded in an IDE. There is a third category of profilers, ones that are external to the JDK and IDEs. This section reviews three of the most prevalent profilers in this category. These are specialized tools that can give us deeper insights, based on sophisticated analysis of our <span class="No-Break">runtime applications.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-264"><a id="_idTextAnchor263"/>YourKit Java Profiler</h2>

			<h1 id="_idParaDest-275"><a id="_idTextAnchor274"/>Practical profiling strategies</h1>
			<p>The<a id="_idIndexMarker781"/> benefits of profiling our Java applications to help identify and resolve performance issues have been established. We will next explore effective profiling strategies so that you can optimize your Java applications efficiently. This section covers strategies to identify performance bottlenecks and differentiate profiling approaches between development and production environments. We will also look at how to implement continuous profiling for long-term <span class="No-Break">performance management.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-276"><a id="_idTextAnchor275"/>Identifying performance bottlenecks</h2>
			<p>The<a id="_idIndexMarker782"/> primary goal of profiling is to identify performance bottlenecks. We can adopt several strategies to achieve this goal, including <span class="No-Break">the following:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li>Begin by monitoring CPU usage, memory consumption, and response times. These high-level metrics can help you identify areas that require <span class="No-Break">deeper analysis.</span></li>
				<li>Consider using sampling profilers that can quickly identify methods that consume the most CPU time. Tools such as JVisualVM and IntelliJ IDEA Profiler provide this type of functionality. The goal is to use sampling to pinpoint issues without a significant impact <span class="No-Break">on performance.</span></li>
				<li>Once you have identified an area for deeper analysis, use instrumentation profiling, such as what is provided by JProfiler and YourKit Java Profiler. These tools can help you examine specific code paths <span class="No-Break">and methods.</span></li>
				<li>Be sure to analyze your application’s thread activity. This is critical for applications that employ concurrent processing. Tools such as JMC and NetBeans Profiler have extensive thread analysis functionality. They can be used to detect thread contention, deadlocks, and even <span class="No-Break">inefficient synchronization.</span></li>
				<li>Use <a id="_idIndexMarker783"/>memory profilers to analyze object allocations, identify objects that are not collected by Java’s garbage collector, and capture heap dumps. Tools such as JProfiler and YourKit Java Profiler have this capability and help identify potential <span class="No-Break">memory leaks.</span></li>
				<li>Finally, if your application makes extensive use of database interactions or input/output operations, use profilers that can provide insight into JDBC calls and input/output. The aim is to identify inefficient queries and <span class="No-Break">input/output bottlenecks.</span></li>
			</ul>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-277"><a id="_idTextAnchor276"/>Profiling in development versus production</h2>
			<p>How <a id="_idIndexMarker784"/>and what we profile should be informed by our current environment. Profiling in a development environment should be approached differently than profiling a running application <span class="No-Break">in production.</span></p>

			<p>Understanding<a id="_idIndexMarker785"/> the differences in profiling based on your application’s environment can help you conduct efficient profiling, subsequently allowing you to enhance your Java <span class="No-Break">application’s performance.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-278"><a id="_idTextAnchor277"/>Continuous profiling</h2>
			<p>We should <a id="_idIndexMarker786"/>profile throughout the development process and then continuously once our application is in production. Implementing continuous profiling includes the <span class="No-Break">following aspects:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li>Establishing performance baselines so that you can compare future profiling results <span class="No-Break">to them</span></li>
				<li>Integrating profiling with your <span class="No-Break">CI/CD pipelines</span></li>
				<li>Ensuring you are monitoring key performance metrics including CPU use, memory use, and <span class="No-Break">response times</span></li>
				<li>Storing your polling data so that you can conduct <span class="No-Break">historical analysis</span></li>
				<li>In addition to routine monitoring, conducting full profiling audits at <span class="No-Break">regular intervals</span></li>
				<li>Ensuring to communicate profiling results with the development team so that they are informed and can enhance the performance of your current system, helping to make future applications <span class="No-Break">more performant</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>These practical<a id="_idIndexMarker787"/> profiling strategies can help identify and resolve performance bottlenecks. It is important to establish a formal profiling approach that can be <span class="No-Break">meticulously followed.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-279"><a id="_idTextAnchor278"/>Case studies</h1>
			<p>This<a id="_idIndexMarker788"/> section details three case studies to illustrate the practical implementation of profiling tools in<a id="_idIndexMarker789"/> <span class="No-Break">real-world scenarios.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-280"><a id="_idTextAnchor279"/>Case study 1 – profiling a large enterprise application</h2>
			<p><strong class="bold">Scenario</strong>: A large <a id="_idIndexMarker790"/>global financial services company developed, tested, and deployed an enterprise application to handle their transactions and reporting. Recently, the application started experiencing performance degradation. This was especially evident during peak user <span class="No-Break">transaction times.</span></p>
			<p><strong class="bold">Profiling tools</strong>: The development team selected JProfiler for its capability to provide detailed profiling and because it integrated with their <span class="No-Break">development environment.</span></p>
			<p><strong class="bold">Process implemented</strong>: The company took a three-step approach <span class="No-Break">to profiling:</span></p>
			<ol>
				<li>They first conducted an initial analysis, looking at CPU use, memory use, and <span class="No-Break">thread analysis.</span></li>
				<li>Next, they used the profiler data from <em class="italic">step 1</em> to <span class="No-Break">identify bottlenecks.</span></li>
				<li>The third step was to optimize their enterprise application. This optimization included rewriting inefficient algorithms, implementing more efficient data structures, optimizing object creation and disposal, and reducing thread contention by implementing a refined <span class="No-Break">locking mechanism.</span></li>
			</ol>
			<p><strong class="bold">Outcome</strong>: Transaction times significantly improved, and memory consumption was now stable. Moreover, the improved application was now able to handle peak load times without network latency issues or impact on the <span class="No-Break">user experience.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-281"><a id="_idTextAnchor280"/>Case study 2 – performance tuning in a microservices architecture</h2>
			<p><strong class="bold">Scenario</strong>: A<a id="_idIndexMarker791"/> technology company developed a large-scale e-commerce application using a microservices architecture. There are a lot of microservices with the primary ones handling user authentication, product inventories, product catalogs, payment transactions, and order processing. Staff and users have reported intermittent latency issues and <span class="No-Break">occasional timeouts.</span></p>
			<p><strong class="bold">Profiling tools</strong>: The tech company selected JMC for profiling, based on its low overhead and ability to monitor applications in production <span class="No-Break">using JFR.</span></p>
			<p><strong class="bold">Process implemented</strong>: The company decided to enable JFR recordings on all microservices. Their plan was to collect detailed performance data without a significant impact on performance. Next, they used JMC to analyze the JFR data to identify resource usage patterns and <span class="No-Break">potential hotspots.</span></p>
			<p>Analysis revealed their product catalog service had sporadic CPU usage spikes that impacted overall response times. Their thread profiling analysis shows that the order processing service caused timeouts, based on thread contention. They also reviewed network profiling data, which showed the payment transaction service’s database interactions had <span class="No-Break">high latency.</span></p>
			<p>With profiling and analysis complete, the development team optimized their e-commerce application. Specifically, they optimized the product catalog service by implementing a caching mechanism. The order processing service was rewritten with an optimized thread management schema, using thread pools. Lastly, the payment transaction service’s database queries were optimized, and connection pooling <span class="No-Break">was implemented.</span></p>
			<p><strong class="bold">Outcome</strong>: The technology company’s e-commerce system showed improved performance following the optimizations. Latency was reduced and it was significantly more stable, with few timeouts. The staff reported improved satisfaction and user <span class="No-Break">complaints waned.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-282"><a id="_idTextAnchor281"/>Case study 3 – profiling and optimizing a high-throughput system</h2>
			<p><strong class="bold">Scenario</strong>: A <a id="_idIndexMarker792"/>communications company uses a system for high throughput and real-time data processing and analytics. Their system has significant performance degradation during high load times. This leads to delays in data processing and <span class="No-Break">analysis operations.</span></p>
			<p><strong class="bold">Profiling tools</strong>: The company selected the YourKit Java Profiler tool because it has comprehensive features, and it is ideal for <span class="No-Break">high-throughput systems.</span></p>
			<p><strong class="bold">Process implemented</strong>: The communication company’s development team adopted a three-step approach – conduct initial profiling, identify bottlenecks, <span class="No-Break">and optimize.</span></p>
			<p>The initial profiling included a look at CPU and memory use. They focused on data processing and analytic components of their system. They also conducted a detailed thread analysis to help identify bottlenecks evident in <span class="No-Break">thread processing.</span></p>
			<p>Their second step was to identify bottlenecks. Their CPU profiling reviewed that some of their data processing modules contained complex computations, which have a significant draw on CPU use. Their memory profiling results indicated that their analytics module had high memory usage. That same module showed frequent garbage collection events that negatively impacted the system’s overall performance. They also looked at thread analysis results, which showed thread contention during peak data loads, further <span class="No-Break">reducing performance.</span></p>
			<p>The company’s last step was to optimize its system. They optimized their data processing algorithms to improve the efficiency of their computations and enhanced parallel processing to take advantage of multi-core processors. Developers also optimized their analytics module by reducing object creation, improving data structures, and minimizing garbage collection. The team also optimized how their application managed threads. They introduced thread pools to reduce <span class="No-Break">thread contention.</span></p>
			<p><strong class="bold">Outcome</strong>: The communication company’s high-throughput system realized significant performance improvements following the system optimizations. Their data processing times were reduced by 55% and latency during analytics processing was minimized. Their system can now handle high data loads efficiently and meet real-time data <span class="No-Break">processing requirements.</span></p>
			<p>The three case studies demonstrate a practical application of profiling strategies and tools in various contexts. They all used a similar three-step approach (profile, identify, optimize) and had <span class="No-Break">successful outcomes.</span></p>
