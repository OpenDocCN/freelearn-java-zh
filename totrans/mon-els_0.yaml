  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There are many books and online tutorials that cover the Elasticsearch API and
    how to configure a cluster. But, until now, there hasn't been a thorough, accessible
    resource for monitoring and troubleshooting purposes. We've found that Elasticsearch
    monitoring tools drastically improve our ability to solve cluster issues and greatly
    increase cluster reliability and performance as a result. We wrote this book to
    share those use cases and the insights that came out of them.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This book covers how to use several popular open source and commercial Elasticsearch
    monitoring tools, namely, Elasticsearch-head, Bigdesk, Marvel, Kopf, and Kibana.
    There's also a section on the Elasticsearch cat API and how to use Nagios to perform
    general system monitoring. Moreover, we will discuss several case studies with
    real-world examples of troubleshooting Elasticsearch issues using these tools.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We believe that the best way to learn is to do. In this book, we'll go over
    how to set up a sample Elasticsearch cluster and load it with data. At times,
    we'll deliberately introduce problems into the cluster so that we can see how
    the errors are tracked using our various monitoring tools. Following along with
    these examples in your own cluster will help you learn both how to use the monitoring
    tools and how to tackle new and unknown issues that may arise.

- en: After reading this book, we hope that you will be better equipped to run and
    maintain an Elasticsearch cluster. You will also be more prepared to diagnose
    and solve cluster issues, such as a node going down, the Elasticsearch process
    dying, configuration errors, shard errors, `OutOfMemoryError` exceptions, slow
    queries, and slow indexing performance.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To follow along with the examples in this book, you'll need a real or virtualized
    three-node Elasticsearch cluster. You may optionally want two other nodes to run
    Marvel and Nagios, covered in [Chapter 4](ch04.html "Chapter 4. Marvel Dashboard"),
    *Marvel Dashboard,* and [Chapter 5](ch05.html "Chapter 5. System Monitoring"),
    *System Monitoring,* respectively. It is possible to run Marvel and Nagios on
    the same host as a node in your Elasticsearch cluster, but you shouldn't do this
    in a production cluster. Check out VMWare Player ([https://www.vmware.com/products/player](https://www.vmware.com/products/player))
    and VirtualBox ([https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads))
    for standing up your own virtual five-node environment or Amazon EC2 ([https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/))
    for building a cluster in the cloud.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For your Elasticsearch nodes, you'll need a 64-bit version of Windows, Mac OS
    X, or Linux and a recent distribution of the Java Runtime Environment. The CPU
    speed doesn't matter as much on these hosts, but we recommend that you have at
    least 512 MB of memory per node. We use Ubuntu 14.04 and Oracle Java 7 for all
    examples in this book, but any modern operating system and either OpenJDK or Oracle
    Java 7 and 8 will work for running through the examples. The only exception is
    Nagios, which needs to run on Linux.
