			<h1 id="_idParaDest-6"><a id="_idTextAnchor005"/>Preface</h1>
			<p>Micronaut is a JVM-based framework for building lightweight, modular applications. It is a fast-growing framework designed to make creating microservices quick and easy. This book will help full stack/Java developers to build modular, high-performing, and reactive microservices-based applications using Micronaut.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-7"><a id="_idTextAnchor006"/>Who this book is for</h1>
			<p>This book is for developers who have been building microservices on traditional frameworks such as Spring Boot and are looking for a faster alternative. Intermediate knowledge of Java programming is required, along with a intermediate knowledge of implementing web services development in Java.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-8"><a id="_idTextAnchor007"/>What this book covers</h1>
			<p><a href="B16585_01_Final_VK_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor015"><em class="italic">Chapter 1</em></a>, <em class="italic">Getting Started with Microservices Using the Micronaut Framework</em>, kicks off with some conceptual fundamentals on microservices and microservices design patterns. You are then introduced to the Micronaut framework and why this is the ideal framework for developing microservices. Later, you will get hands-on with the Micronaut framework by working on hello-world projects using Maven and Gradle.</p>
			<p><a href="B16585_02_Final_VK_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor033"><em class="italic">Chapter 2</em></a>, <em class="italic">Working on Data Access</em>, covers aspects of working with various kinds of database and persistence frameworks. You will begin with an object-relational mapping framework while doing a hands-on Hibernate framework and then dive into using a persistence framework (MyBatis). Finally, you will also integrate with a non-relational database (MongoDB).</p>
			<p><a href="B16585_03_Final_VK_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor065"><em class="italic">Chapter 3</em></a>, <em class="italic">Working on RESTful Web Services</em>, starts with a discussion on data transfer objects and mappers. You then dive into working with RESTful interfaces in the Micronaut framework. Later, you will learn about Micronaut's HTTP server and client APIs.</p>
			<p><a href="B16585_04_Final_VK_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor090"><em class="italic">Chapter 4</em></a>, <em class="italic">Securing Web Services</em>, covers various approaches in securing web endpoints in the Micronaut framework, such as session authentication, JWT, and OAuth.</p>
			<p><a href="B16585_05_Final_VK_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor106"><em class="italic">Chapter 5</em></a>, <em class="italic">Integrating Microservices Using Event-Driven Architecture</em>, starts with event-driven architecture and two different models for event publishing: a pull model and a push model. You then dive into event streaming and using Apache Kafka for integrating two microservices in the pet-clinic application (sample project).</p>
			<p><a href="B16585_06_Final_VK_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor120"><em class="italic">Chapter 6</em></a>, <em class="italic">Testing the Microservices</em>, sheds some light on various kinds of automated testing – unit testing, service testing, and integration testing, and how to employ these testing techniques in adopting a prudent automated testing policy to reduce cost and increase the robustness of microservices.</p>
			<p><a href="B16585_07_Final_VK_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor132"><em class="italic">Chapter 7</em></a>, <em class="italic">Handling the Microservices Concerns</em>, covers some core concerns while working on the microservices, such as distributed configuration management, documenting service APIs, service discovery, and the API gateway. Later, you also explore the mechanisms for fault tolerance in the Micronaut framework.</p>
			<p><a href="B16585_08_Final_VK_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor146"><em class="italic">Chapter 8</em></a>, <em class="italic">Deploying the Microservices</em>, covers the build and deployment aspects of microservices. You will kick things off by building the container artifacts using an automated tool and then leverage Docker Compose to deploy the microservices.</p>
			<p><a href="B16585_09_Final_VK_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor155"><em class="italic">Chapter 9</em></a>, <em class="italic">Distributed Logging, Tracing, and Monitoring</em>, throws light on implementing the observability patterns in microservices with distributed logging, distributed tracing, and distributed monitoring.</p>
			<p><a href="B16585_10_Final_VK_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor172"><em class="italic">Chapter 10</em></a>, <em class="italic">IoT with Micronaut</em>, jumpstarts with an introduction to IoT with Alexa, covering Alexa fundamentals and a hello-world example. Later, you will be able to integrate Micronaut with Alexa while working on the pet-clinic application.</p>
			<p><a href="B16585_11_Final_VK_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor183"><em class="italic">Chapter 11</em></a>, <em class="italic">Building Enterprise-Grade Microservices</em>, covers the best practices for working on the microservices and how to build and scale enterprise-grade microservices.</p>
