- en: The book gives an overview and explanation of the new features introduced in
    Java 9 and the importance of the new APIs and enhancements. Some of the new features
    of Java 9 are groundbreaking, and if you are an experienced programmer, you will
    be able to make your enterprise application leaner by implementing these new features.
    You will be provided with practical guidance in applying the newly acquired knowledge
    in regards to Java 9 and further information on future developments of the Java
    platform. This book will improve your productivity, making your applications faster.
    By learning the best practices in Java, you will become the *go-to* person in
    your organization for Java 9.
