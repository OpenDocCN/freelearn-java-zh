The Scala language is a multi-paradigm language used by big players and large organizations that helps you get the correct (in the sense of pure functional programming) software and, at the same time, software that is practical and scalable.</p><p>Scala has a very rich ecosystem, including Play Framework, Akka, Slick, Gatling, Finable, and more. In this book, we will start right from the basic principles and ideas on functional and ReactiveX programming, and through practical examples, you will learn how to code with the most important frameworks of the Scala ecosystem, such as Play, Akka, and Slick.  </p><p>You will learn how to bootstrap a Scala application with SBT and Activator, how to build a Play and Akka application step by step, and we cover the theory of how to scale massive Scala applications with cloud and the NetflixOSS stack.  This book will help you to go from the basic subjects to the most advanced ones in order to make you a Scala expert.</p><div class="section" title="What this book covers"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="pf08lvl1sec1"/>What this book covers</h1></div></div></div><p>
