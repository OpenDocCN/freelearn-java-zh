			<p>You already know you want to learn Java, and a smarter way to learn Java 12 is to learn by doing. <em class="italic">The Java Workshop</em> focuses on building up your practical skills so that you can develop high-performance Java applications that work flawlessly within the JVM across web, mobile and desktop. You'll learn from real examples that lead to real results. </p>
			<p>Throughout The Java Workshop, you'll take an engaging step-by-step approach to understanding Java. You won't have to sit through any unnecessary theory. If you're short on time you can jump into a single exercise each day or spend an entire weekend learning about Reactive programming and Unit testing. It's your choice. Learning on your terms, you'll build up and reinforce key skills in a way that feels rewarding. </p>
			<p>Every physical print copy of <em class="italic">The Java Workshop</em> unlocks access to the interactive edition. With videos detailing all exercises and activities, you'll always have a guided solution. You can also benchmark yourself against assessments, track progress, and receive free content updates. You'll even earn a secure credential that you can share and verify online upon completion. It's a premium learning experience that's included with your printed copy. To redeem, follow the instructions located at the start of your Java book. </p>
			<p>Fast-paced and direct, <em class="italic">The Java Workshop</em> is the ideal companion for Java beginners. You'll build and iterate on your code like a software developer, learning along the way. This process means that you'll find that your new skills stick, embedded as best practice.

			<h2 id="_idParaDest-4"><a id="_idTextAnchor005"/>Conventions</h2>
			<p>Code words in text, database table names, folder names, filenames, file extensions, pathnames, dummy URLs, user input, and Twitter handles are shown as follows: "You can nest <strong class="source-inline">if</strong> statements within any block of code, including the block of code that follows an if statement.".</p>
			<p>Words that you see on the screen, for example, in menus or dialog boxes, also appear in the text like this: "<strong class="source-inline">Click</strong> on <strong class="source-inline">Create</strong> <strong class="source-inline">New</strong> <strong class="source-inline">Project</strong>."<a id="_idTextAnchor006"/></p>
			<p>A block of code is set as follows:</p>
			<p class="source-code">if (i == 5) {</p>
			<p class="source-code">System.out.println("i is 5");</p>
			<p class="source-code">}</p>
			<p class="source-code">i = 0;</p>
			<p>New terms and important words are shown like this: "This kind of data is what we call a <strong class="bold">variable</strong> <strong class="bold">type</strong>."</p>
			<p>Large code snippets are truncated and the corresponding names of the code files on GitHub are placed at the top of the truncated code. The permalinks to the entire code are placed below the code snippet. It should look as follows:</p>
			<p class="source-code-heading">Exercise02.java</p>
			<p class="source-code">6  if (distanceToHome &gt; maxDistance) {</p>
			<p class="source-code">7  System.out.println("Distance from the store to your home is");</p>
			<p class="source-code">8  System.out.println(" more than " + maxDistance + "km away.");</p>
			<p class="source-code">9  System.out.println("That is too far for free delivery.");</p>
