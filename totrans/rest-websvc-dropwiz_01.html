You can have a production-ready application, making use of <span class="strong"><strong>Jetty</strong></span>, <span class="strong"><strong>Jersey</strong></span>, <span class="strong"><strong>Jackson</strong></span>, <span class="strong"><strong>JDBI</strong></span>, and <span class="strong"><strong>Hibernate</strong></span>, as well as a large number of additional libraries that Dropwizard includes, either in its core or as modules. This solves the problem of manually adding, configuring, and wiring together lots of different libraries while building a web service application from scratch. Think of it like this: you will need Jersey to expose the web services, some other library for database interaction, and additional ones for validation and authentication, not to mention the overhead of dependency management, packaging, and distribution.</p><p>Throughout the chapters of this book, we are going to use Dropwizard and its components in order to build a sample application—that is, a phonebook application that exposes a set of RESTful Web Services that facilitate the storing and management of contacts. It works pretty much like your mobile phone's built-in phonebook application or any other contact management application.</p><div class="section" title="Web service development with Dropwizard"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl1sec08"/>Web service development with Dropwizard</h1></div></div></div><p>We <a id="id0" class="indexterm"/>are going to use Jersey in order to <a id="id1" class="indexterm"/>build our web services. Jersey is the reference implementation of the <span class="strong"><strong>JAX-RS</strong></span> standard (JSR 311), the Java API for RESTful Web Services. JAX-RS makes use of annotations, simplifying the development of web service applications.</p><p>The web services we'll build are going to produce JSON output. Dropwizard includes Jackson, which is a fast, configurable JSON processor, and is used by Jersey to transform plain Java objects to JSON representations.</p><p>Our application is going to use a database in order to store data. For our database interaction needs, we'll use JDBI. JDBI is a library that will allow us to easily create DAO interfaces. Data Access Objects would allow us to perform database operations by mapping Java methods to SQL queries and statements. JDBI comes as a Dropwizard module, allowing us to build Data Access Objects easily and fast.</p><p>Dropwizard includes validation, monitoring, and testing modules, which we'll use to ensure that our services will behave correctly in production environments. We are going to<a id="id2" class="indexterm"/> integrate Dropwizard's validation<a id="id3" class="indexterm"/> mechanisms, ensuring that each and every request to our web services is valid, before trying to serve it.</p></div></div>

We will use it to create and build our project. Our application's dependencies (on Dropwizard's modules) will be managed by Maven; we just need to add the appropriate entries in our project configuration file.</p><p>We need a database, so we will use MySQL for the needs of this book. MySQL is the most popular open source relational database management system—a common choice for web applications. Throughout the installation process, you will be prompted to create or configure the values of environment variables. This procedure varies from one operating system to another, and is something out of the scope of this book.</p></div><div class="section" title="How to do it…"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl2sec08"/>How to do it…</h2></div></div></div><p>We will take a look at all the components that you will need to download and install.</p><div class="section" title="Downloading and installing Java"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl3sec01"/>Downloading and installing Java</h3></div></div></div><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic"><li class="listitem">Download<a id="id5" class="indexterm"/> Java 7 JDK from <a class="ulink" href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk7-downloads-1880260.html">http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk7-downloads-1880260.html</a>.</li><li class="listitem">Since<a id="id6" class="indexterm"/> many installation packages are available, you need to select the appropriate one, depending on your operating system and platform.</li><li class="listitem">After the download has completed, install the JDK by running the installer you downloaded, as shown in the following screenshot.
