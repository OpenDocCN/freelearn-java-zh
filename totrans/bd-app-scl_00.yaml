- en: Functional programming started in academia and ended up in the IT industry.
    The Scala language is a multi-paradigm language used by big players and large organizations
    that helps you get the correct (in the sense of pure functional programming) software
    and, at the same time, software that is practical and scalable.

- en: Scala has a very rich ecosystem, including Play Framework, Akka, Slick, Gatling,
    Finable, and more. In this book, we will start right from the basic principles
    and ideas on functional and ReactiveX programming, and through practical examples,
    you will learn how to code with the most important frameworks of the Scala ecosystem,
    such as Play, Akka, and Slick.

- en: You will learn how to bootstrap a Scala application with SBT and Activator,
    how to build a Play and Akka application step by step, and we cover the theory
    of how to scale massive Scala applications with cloud and the NetflixOSS stack.
     This book will help you to go from the basic subjects to the most advanced ones
    in order to make you a Scala expert.
