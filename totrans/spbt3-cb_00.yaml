- en: Spring Boot is Java’s most popular framework for web and microservices development.
    It allows you to create production-grade applications with minimal configuration,
    following its “convention over configuration approach.”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Spring Boot is always evolving and adapting to the latest technology trends.
    Its ecosystem allows you to integrate with any technology, from databases to AI,
    and use traversal features such as observability and security. You can use it
    for virtually any type of application.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In this book, we’ll cover the most common scenarios in a hands-on way, and you’ll
    learn the foundations to use the vast features available.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This book is for Java developers who want to gain expertise in modern web development,
    architects designing complex systems, experienced Spring Boot developers and technology
    enthusiasts looking to stay up to date with the latest trends, and software engineers
    in need of practical solutions for everyday challenges. Hands-on experience with
    Java is required. Prior development experience on the cloud will be useful, but
    not necessary.

    and Application Management*, explores how to leverage the observability features
    available in Spring Boot with Actuator. This chapter uses Open Zipkin, Prometheus,
    and Grafana, consuming the observability data exposed by a Spring Boot application
    for monitoring.'

    to use Spring Cloud to develop a distributed system composed of several microservices.
    We’ll use Eureka Server, Spring Cloud Gateway, Spring Config, and Spring Boot
    Admin.'

    Database Integration with Spring Data*, delves into how to integrate an application
    with PostgreSQL using Spring Data JPA. You will define repositories and use **Java
    Persistance Query Language** (**JPQL**) and Native SQL. You will learn to use
    transactions, database versioning, and migrations with Flyway, and Testcontainers
    for integration tests.'

    Database Integration with Spring Data*, explains the benefits and trade-offs of
    using NoSQL databases such as MongoDB and Cassandra, teaching you how to tackle
    some common challenges of NoSQL databases, such as data partitioning or concurrency
    management. You will use Testcontainers for integration tests with MongoDB and
    Cassandra.'

    Your Application*, describes how to run a load test using JMeter against a Spring
    Boot application, apply different optimizations, such as caching or building a
    native application, and compare the improvements with the original results. You
    will also learn some useful techniques to prepare a Native application, such as
    using the GraalVM Tracing Agent.'

    Cloud Stream*, explores how to use Spring Reactive for high concurrency scenarios,
    creating a reactive RESTful API, a reactive API client, and the R2DBC driver for
    PostgreSQL. You will learn how to create an event-driven application, using Spring
    Cloud Stream connected to a RabbitMQ server.'

    application to the latest version of Spring Boot 3\. You will prepare the application
    before upgrading to Spring Boot 3 and fix all the issues, step by step, after
    the upgrade. You will also learn how to use OpenRewrite to automate part of the
    migration process.'

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You will need the JDK 21 for all the chapters of this book. In [*Chapter 9*](B21646_09.xhtml#_idTextAnchor407),
    you will also need JDK 11 and JDK 17\. I recommend using a tool such as SDKMAN!
    to install and configure the SDK on your computer. If you use Windows, you can
    use the JDK installer.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I used Maven as a dependency and build system for all samples. You can optionally
    install it on your computer, but all projects created in this book use the Maven
    Wrapper, which downloads all dependencies if needed.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you are a Windows user, I recommend using **Windows Subsystem for Linux**
    (**WSL**), as some of the complementary tools used in this book are available
    in Linux, and the scripts available in the book’s GitHub repository are tested
    in Linux only. Indeed, I’m a Windows user and used WSL for all the samples prepared
    for this book.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I also recommend installing Docker, as it’s the simplest way to run some of
    the services integrated with this book, such as PostgreSQL. Docker is the best
    option to run a distributed system, composed of different applications talking
    to each other on your computer. In addition, most of the integration tests use
    Testcontainers, which requires Docker.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I tried to explain all samples without specific IDE requirements in this book.
    I used Visual Studio Code, primarily for its excellent integration with WSL, but
    you can use any other IDE of your preference, such as IntelliJ or Eclipse.
