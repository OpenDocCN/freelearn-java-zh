  zh: 前言
- en: In the last few years, we have seen a widespread tendency to create new languages
    for JVM. There are all sorts of new languages with different paradigms and different
    ways of working. Clojure is one of those languages, one that we believe is worth
    learning.

  zh: 在过去几年中，我们看到了在JVM上创建新语言的普遍趋势。有各种不同范式和工作方式的新语言。Clojure就是其中之一，我们认为它值得学习。
- en: The Java Virtual Machine plays a huge role in the performance of the Clojure
    programs. Clojure brings functional programming to the Java Virtual Machine (JVM),
    and also to web browsers through ClojureScript.

  zh: Java虚拟机在Clojure程序的性能中扮演着至关重要的角色。Clojure将函数式编程引入Java虚拟机（JVM），并通过ClojureScript引入到网页浏览器中。
- en: With the recent rise of parallel data processing and multicore architectures,
    functional programming languages have become more popular for creating software
    that is both provable and performant. Like other functional programming languages,
    Clojure focuses on the use of functions and immutable data structures for writing
    programs. Clojure also adds a hint of Lisp through the use of symbolic expressions
    and a dynamic type system.

  zh: 随着并行数据处理和多核架构的最近兴起，函数式编程语言在创建既可证明又高效软件方面变得更加流行。与其他函数式编程语言一样，Clojure专注于使用函数和不可变数据结构来编写程序。Clojure还通过使用符号表达式和动态类型系统添加了Lisp的痕迹。

  zh: 本学习路径涵盖的内容
- en: '[Module 1](pt01.html "Part 1. Module 1"), *Clojure for Java Developers*, introduces
    you to Clojure and how opinionated it is. You will learn why immutable objects
    are not only possible, but it is a good idea to use them. You will also learn
    about functional programming and see how it fits the concept of immutable programs.
    You will understand the very powerful idea of representing your code as a data
    structure of the same language. Further, we will find similarities and differences
    from the Java language that you already know, so you can understand how the Clojure
    world works.'

  zh: '[模块1](pt01.html "第1部分。模块1")，*面向Java开发者的Clojure*，向您介绍Clojure及其观点。您将了解为什么不可变对象不仅可行，而且使用它们是一个好主意。您还将了解函数式编程，并了解它如何适应不可变程序的概念。您将理解将代码表示为相同语言的数据结构的强大理念。此外，我们将找出与您已知的Java语言的相似之处和不同之处，以便您理解Clojure世界是如何运作的。'
- en: '[Module 2](pt02.html "Part 2. Module 2"), *, Clojure High Performance Programming,
    Second Edition*, increases the focus on the JVM tools for performance management,
    and it explores how to use those. This module will equip the you with performance
    measurement and profiling tools and with the know-how of analyzing and tuning
    the performance characteristics of Clojure code.'

- en: '[Module 3](pt03.html "Part 3. Module 3"), *, Mastering Clojure*, walks you
    through the interesting features of the Clojure language. We will also discuss
    some of the more advanced and lesser known programming constructs in Clojure.
    Several libraries from the Clojure ecosystem that we can put to practical use
    in our own programs will also be described. You won’t need to be convinced any
    more about the elegance and power of the Clojure language by the time you’ve finished
    this module.'

    should be easier to follow in environments where there is a shell available. (We
    focus mainly on Mac OS X.)

  zh: 您需要Java SDK。您应该能够在任何操作系统上运行示例；在我们的示例中，如果环境中有一个shell，应该更容易理解。（我们主要关注Mac OS X。）
- en: You should acquire Java Development Kit version 8 or higher (which you can obtain
    from [http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/))
    for your operating system to work through all the examples. This book discusses
    the Oracle HotSpot JVM, so you may want to get Oracle JDK or OpenJDK (or Zulu)
    if possible. You should also get the latest Leiningen version from [http://leiningen.org/](http://leiningen.org/),
    and JD-GUI from [http://jd.benow.ca/](http://jd.benow.ca/).

- en: You’ll also need a text editor or an integrated development environment (IDE).
    If you already have a text editor that you prefer, you can probably use it. Navigate
    to [http://dev.clojure.org/display/doc/Getting+Started](http://dev.clojure.org/display/doc/Getting+Started)
    for a list of environment-specific plugins to write code in Clojure. If you don’t
    have a preference, it is suggested that you use Eclipse with Counterclockwise
    ([http://doc.ccw-ide.org/](http://doc.ccw-ide.org/)) or Light Table ([http://lighttable.com/](http://lighttable.com/)).
    Some examples in this book will also require a web browser, such as Chrome (42
    or above), Firefox (38 or above), or Microsoft Internet Explorer (9 or above).
