Microservices helps in decomposing applications into small services and move away from a single monolithic artifact. In that case, we can build systems that are scalable, flexible, and high resilient. Spring Boot helps in building such REST-oriented, production-grade microservices.</p><p>So, if you want to build microservices with Spring Boot, you are in the right path.</p><div class="section" title="What's in It for Me?"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl1sec02"/>What's in It for Me?</h1></div></div></div><p>Maps are vital for your journey, especially when you're holidaying in another continent. When it comes to learning, a roadmap helps you in giving a definitive path for progressing towards the goal. So, here you're presented with a roadmap before you begin your journey.</p><p>This book is meticulously designed and developed in order to empower you with all the right and relevant information on Spring Boot. We've created this Learning Path for you that consists of three lessons:</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch01.html" title="Chapter 1. Building Microservices with Spring Boot">Lesson 1</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Building Microservices with Spring Boot</em></span>, covers the basics of Spring Boot and REST services. You will explore different features of Spring Boot and create a few REST services with great tests.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch02.html" title="Chapter 2. Extending Microservices">Lesson 2</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Extending Microservices</em></span>, covers how to add features such as exception handling, caching, and internationalization to your application. You will learn the best practices of documenting REST services using Swagger. You will look at the basics of securing your microservices with Spring Security.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch03.html" title="Chapter 3. Advanced Spring Boot Features">Lesson 3</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Advanced Spring Boot Features</em></span>, takes a look at the advanced features in Spring Boot. You will learn how to monitor a microservice with a Spring Boot Actuator. You will then learn how to deploy the microservice to Cloud. You will also learn how to develop more effectively with the developer tools provided by Spring Boot.</p></div></div>
