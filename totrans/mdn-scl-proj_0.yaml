- en: Scala, along with the Spark Framework, forms a rich and powerful data processing
    ecosystem. This book is a journey into the depths of this ecosystem. The machine
    learning (ML) projects presented in this book enable you to create practical,
    robust, data analytics solutions, with an emphasis on automating data workflows
    with the Spark ML pipeline API. This book showcases, or carefully cherry-picks
    from, Scala’s functional libraries and other constructs to help readers roll out
    their own scalable data processing frameworks. The projects in this book enable
    data practitioners across all industries to gain insights into data that will
    help organizations to obtain a strategic and competitive advantage. *Modern Scala
    Projects* focuses on the application of supervisory learning ML techniques that
    classify data and make predictions. You'll begin with working on a project to
    predict a class of flower by implementing a simple machine learning model. Next,
    you'll create a cancer diagnosis classification pipeline, followed by projects
    delving into stock price prediction, spam filtering, fraud detection, and a recommendation
    engine.

- en: '[Chapter 1](4d645e21-43b1-49dd-99ad-4059360bfc15.xhtml), *Predict the Class
    of a Flower from the Iris Dataset*, focuses on building a machine learning model
    leveraging a time-tested statistical method based on regression. The chapter draws
    the reader into data processing, all the way to training and testing a relatively
    simple machine learning model.'

    Prognosis Pipeline with the Power of Spark and Scala*, taps into a publicly available
    breast cancer dataset. It evaluates various feature selection algorithms, transforms
    data, and builds a classification model.'

    that stock price prediction can be an impossible task. In this chapter, we take
    a new approach. Accordingly, we build and train a neural network model with training
    data to solve the apparently intractable problem of stock price prediction. A
    data pipeline, with Spark at its core, distributes training of the model across
    multiple machines in a cluster. A real-life dataset is fed into the pipeline.
    Training data goes through preprocessing and normalization steps before a model
    is trained to fit the data. We may also provide a means to visualize the results
    of our prediction and evaluate our model after training.'

    Pipeline*, informs the reader that the overarching learning objective of this
    chapter is to implement a spam filtering data analysis pipeline. We will rely
    on the Spark ML library''s machine learning APIs and its supporting libraries
    to build a spam classification pipeline.'

    System*, applies machine learning techniques and algorithms to build a practical
    ML pipeline that helps find questionable charges on consumers’ credit cards. The
    data is drawn from a publicly accessible Consumer Complaints Database. The chapter
    demonstrates the tools contained in Spark ML for building, evaluating, and tuning
    a pipeline. Feature extraction is one function served by Spark ML that is covered
    here.'

    Prediction Model*, makes us able to leverage flight departure and arrival data
    to predict for the user if their flight is delayed or canceled. Here, we will
    build a decisions trees-based model to derive useful predictors, such as what
    time of the day is best to have a seat on a flight, with a minimum chance of delay.'

    engine. The collaborative-filtering approach is laid out as the reader walks through
    a phased recommendations-generating process based on users’ past preferences.'
