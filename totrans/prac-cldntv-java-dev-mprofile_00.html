			<h1 id="_idParaDest-6"><a id="_idTextAnchor000"/>Preface</h1>
			<p>MicroProfile provides a set of APIs to facilitate the building of cloud-native applications with best practices. Once you have learned MicroProfile, you can develop a standard cloud-native application, which can be deployed to many runtimes without worrying about migration.</p>
			<p>This book provides a hands-on approach to implementation and associated methodologies that will have you up and running and productive in no time. It comes with an end-to-end application to demonstrate how to build a cloud-native application using MicroProfile 4.1 and then deploy it to the cloud. </p>
			<p>By the end of this book, you will be able to understand MicroProfile and use the APIs in your cloud-native application development with confidence.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-7"><a id="_idTextAnchor001"/>Who this book is for</h1>
			<p>This book is for Java application developers and architects looking to build efficient applications using an open standard framework that performs well in the cloud. DevOps engineers who want to understand how cloud-native applications work will also find this book useful. A basic understanding of Java, Docker, Kubernetes, and cloud is needed to get the most out of this book.</p>
