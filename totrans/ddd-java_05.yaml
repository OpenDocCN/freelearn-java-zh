    **gross domestic product** (**GDP**), making an exchange of capital, goods, and
    services between untrusted parties spread across the globe a necessity. While
    economic organizations such as the **World Trade Organization** (**WTO**) were
    formed specifically to ease and facilitate this process, differences in factors
    such as economic policy, trade laws, and currency ensure that carrying out trade
    internationally can be a complex process, with several entities involved across
    countries. A letter of credit exists to simplify this process. Let’s take a look
    at how it works.

    a variety of banking solutions, such as retail, corporate, securities, and other
    products. They have been steadily expanding operations to other countries and
    continents. This has allowed them to expand their international trade business
    significantly in the last decade. While they have been among the leaders in this
    space, the recent onset of new digital-native competitors has started to eat into
    their business and impact their top line adversely. Customers are complaining
    that the process is too cumbersome, time-consuming, and lately unreliable. In
    addition, due to a very inefficient manual process that is currently in place,
    KP Bank has been finding it very hard to keep a check on costs. In just the last
    3 years, they have had to increase transaction processing costs by around 50 percent!
    Not surprisingly, this has coincided with plummeting customer satisfaction, which
    is evidenced by the fact that the number of customers serviced has remained flat
    over the intervening time.

    by Ash Maurya for lean startups. In contrast to the business model canvas, the
    main emphasis here is to first and foremost elaborate on the problem that needs
    to be solved and explore potential solutions. In order to make the canvas actionable,
    the idea is to capture items that were most uncertain and/or risky. This is pertinent
    for businesses operating under high uncertainty (which is usually true for start-ups).
    Similar to DDD, it encourages you to focus on an issue as the starting point for
    building a business.

    over the timing of payments between the seller (exporter) and the buyer (importer),
    especially due to a lack of trust between the parties involved. For exporters,
    until payment is received, all sales are gifts. Consequently, exporters prefer
    receiving payment as soon as the order is placed or at least before the goods
    are shipped. For importers, until the goods are received, all payments made toward
    a purchase are donations. Consequently, importers prefer receiving goods as soon
    as possible and delaying payment until the goods are resold to generate enough
    money to pay the seller.

    From the bank’s perspective, streamlining the process for these products as a
    priority also provides a greater business opportunity compared to the other products.

    maps to further drill down areas that are important to focus energies on, including
