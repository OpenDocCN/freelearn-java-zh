- en: In this section, we will take an overview of orthogonal context related to architecture
    design and software architecture implementations. Those cross-cutting topics are
    crucial to the success of a project and have to be thoroughly considered during
    the different phases of implementation.

- en: In this section, we are going to cover some additional concepts, useful to define
    the context of software architectures. These include cross-cutting concerns (such
    as identity management and security), the software development life cycle (such
    as source code management, building, and deployment), and visibility (including
    log management, monitoring, and tracing). Our last chapter will be about the Java
    framework per se, including versioning, the vendor ecosystem, and what’s new in
    the latest release.
