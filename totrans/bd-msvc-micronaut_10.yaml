- en: This section will explore the next phase of working on microservices, that is,
    deployment. Firstly, you will focus on handling some core concerns in microservices,
    such as service discovery, API gateways, application configurations, and fault
    tolerance. Later, you will deploy the sample `pet-clinic` application using Docker
    containers.
