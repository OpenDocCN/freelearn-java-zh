    to music while you edit a document in a word processor and read your e-mails.
    This can be done because your operating system allows the concurrency of tasks.
    Concurrent programming is about the elements and mechanisms a platform offers
    to have multiple tasks or programs running at once and communicating with each
    other, to exchange data or to synchronize with each other. Java is a concurrent
    platform, and it offers a lot of classes to execute concurrent tasks inside a
    Java program. With each version, Java increases the functionalities offered to
    programmers to facilitate the development of concurrent programs. This book covers
    the most important and useful mechanisms included in version 9 of the Java concurrency
    API, so you will be able to use them directly in your applications. The mechanisms are
    as follows:'
