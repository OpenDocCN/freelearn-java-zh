			<h1 id="_idParaDest-203"><a id="_idTextAnchor232"/>Fundamentals of serverless computing in java</h1>
			<p>Serverless computing <a id="_idIndexMarker826"/>is a cloud-computing execution model that has revolutionized the way applications are developed and deployed. In this model, the cloud provider dynamically manages the allocation and provisioning of servers, allowing developers to focus on writing code without worrying about the underlying infrastructure. Although applications still run on servers, the management of these servers, including scaling and maintenance, is entirely handled by the cloud provider. This approach marks a significant departure from traditional server-based architectures, where developers are responsible for managing and maintaining the servers that host <span class="No-Break">their applications.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-204"><a id="_idTextAnchor233"/>Core concepts of serverless computing</h2>
			<p>Serverless architectures <a id="_idIndexMarker827"/>are built around several core concepts. One of the key concepts is the event-driven approach, where functions are executed in response to various triggers such as HTTP requests, database events, and device activity. This model is particularly well suited for Java developers because Java’s concurrency features, such as multithreading and asynchronous processing, align seamlessly with the event-driven nature of serverless computing. Additionally, Java’s extensive ecosystem of libraries and tools enhances its integration with cloud functions from providers such as Amazon AWS Lambda, Google Cloud, and Azure Functions. These attributes make Java a powerful choice for developing scalable and efficient <span class="No-Break">serverless applications.</span></p>
			<p>Another crucial concept is statelessness, which means that functions typically execute without retaining any state between invocations. This enables high levels of scalability, as multiple instances of a function can run concurrently without interfering with each other. However, functions can also be designed to be stateful by using external data sources or services, such as AWS Lambda with an external database or Kalix for stateful serverless applications. Serverless platforms also provide automatic scaling based on demand, eliminating the need for manual scaling and ensuring that applications can handle variable <span class="No-Break">workloads efficiently.</span></p>
			<p>Additionally, serverless computing simplifies backend development by offloading routine tasks such as server and database management to the cloud provider, allowing developers to focus on writing business logic. Finally, serverless architectures are highly compatible with microservice architectures, enabling the independent deployment of discrete pieces <span class="No-Break">of functionality.</span></p>
			<p>Traditionally, Java<a id="_idIndexMarker828"/> has not been the first choice for serverless computing due to its verbose syntax and slower startup times compared to languages such as Python or JavaScript. However, recent developments in frameworks such as Quarkus and Micronaut have significantly reduced Java’s startup time and memory usage, boosting its suitability for serverless environments. While Spring Native initially showed promise in this area, it has since been deprecated in favor of the official native support integrated into Spring Boot 3+. This new native support within Spring Boot 3+ offers enhanced features and capabilities, enabling Java developers to create efficient, scalable serverless applications that fully leverage the advantages of <span class="No-Break">cloud-native architectures.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-205"><a id="_idTextAnchor234"/>Advantages of and scenarios for using serverless computing</h2>
			<p>Serverless computing<a id="_idIndexMarker829"/> offers several compelling advantages, particularly in terms of scalability, cost-effectiveness, and reduced <span class="No-Break">operational overhead.</span></p>
			<p>One of the most <a id="_idIndexMarker830"/>significant benefits is enhanced scalability. Serverless architectures can instantly and automatically scale up or down based on the demand for the application. This means that during peak traffic periods, the application can seamlessly handle increased loads without any manual intervention. Additionally, the stateless nature of serverless functions allows them to run concurrently and in parallel, enabling high throughput <span class="No-Break">and responsiveness.</span></p>
			<p>Another key advantage of serverless computing is cost-effectiveness. With a pay-per-use pricing model, you only pay for the resources your functions consume during their execution time. This eliminates the costs associated with idle compute resources, making it an attractive option for applications with variable or sporadic workloads. Moreover, serverless computing can reduce the total cost of ownership by minimizing the need for ongoing server maintenance <span class="No-Break">and management.</span></p>
			<p>Serverless computing offers the potential for reduced operational overhead. By offloading server management tasks such as maintenance, patching, and scaling to the cloud provider, developers can focus more on code and functionality. Deployment processes are often simplified, allowing for quicker updates and feature releases without directly <span class="No-Break">managing infrastructure.</span></p>
			<p>However, it’s <a id="_idIndexMarker831"/>important to note that serverless architectures can introduce their own complexities. Managing multiple runtimes for different<a id="_idIndexMarker832"/> functions or services may require additional configuration and monitoring. This is particularly relevant for larger applications where maintaining consistency across diverse environments can become challenging. While serverless platforms often provide built-in high availability and fault tolerance features, ensuring application resilience may still require careful design <span class="No-Break">and optimization.</span></p>
			<p>Furthermore, serverless architectures can easily integrate with other cloud services and be automatically triggered by events from these services, enabling the creation of highly responsive, event-driven applications and <span class="No-Break">automated workflows.</span></p>
			<p>Overall, serverless computing can be a powerful tool, but it’s important to evaluate its suitability for your specific use case and understand the potential <span class="No-Break">trade-offs involved.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-206"><a id="_idTextAnchor235"/>Drawbacks and trade-offs of serverless computing</h2>
			<p>While serverless computing offers numerous benefits, it also comes with several trade-offs and potential drawbacks that <a id="_idIndexMarker833"/>developers <span class="No-Break">must consider:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Cold starts</strong>: One of the most commonly cited drawbacks is the cold start latency. When a serverless function is invoked after a period of inactivity, it can take some time to initialize, leading to delays in response times. This can be particularly problematic for applications requiring <span class="No-Break">low-latency responses.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Resource limits</strong>: Serverless platforms impose limits on the execution time, memory, and computational resources available to each function. These constraints can make it challenging to run long-running processes or <span class="No-Break">compute-intensive tasks.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Vendor lock-in</strong>: Using serverless architectures often ties developers to a specific cloud provider’s ecosystem, making it difficult to migrate applications to another provider without <span class="No-Break">significant rework.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Complexity in debugging and monitoring</strong>: Debugging serverless functions can be more complex compared to traditional server-based applications. The ephemeral nature of serverless functions and their distributed execution environments can complicate the debugging process. Additionally, monitoring and maintaining observability across multiple serverless functions requires robust tooling <span class="No-Break">and practices.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">State management</strong>: Serverless<a id="_idIndexMarker834"/> functions are inherently stateless, which can complicate the management of application state across multiple invocations. Developers need to use external storage solutions such as databases or caching services to manage state, which can introduce additional complexity <span class="No-Break">and latency.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Cost efficiency</strong>: While serverless computing can be cost-effective for many use cases, it may not always be the most economical option. High-frequency invocations or applications with constant traffic may incur higher costs compared to reserved instances or traditional <span class="No-Break">server-based architectures.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Security concerns</strong>: The abstraction of infrastructure management in serverless computing means that developers have less control over the underlying environment. This can introduce security concerns, as vulnerabilities or misconfigurations in the cloud provider’s infrastructure can potentially affect <span class="No-Break">the application.</span></li>
			</ul>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-207"><a id="_idTextAnchor236"/>When to use serverless?</h2>
			<p>Combining the<a id="_idIndexMarker835"/> advantages outlined previously, here are additional scenarios where serverless computing is <span class="No-Break">particularly beneficial:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Microservice architectures</strong>: Applications designed with microservice architecture, where each service is a small, independently <span class="No-Break">deployable unit.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Event-driven applications</strong>: Systems that respond to various events such as data streams, user actions, or <span class="No-Break">IoT signals.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Stateless processing</strong>: Applications that perform stateless operations, such as image processing, data<a id="_idIndexMarker836"/> transformation, or <strong class="bold">Extract, Transform, Load</strong> (<span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">ETL</strong></span><span class="No-Break">) tasks.</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>However, it’s<a id="_idIndexMarker837"/> important to note that serverless may not be the best fit for every scenario. Some situations where serverless might not be ideal include <span class="No-Break">the following:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li>Applications with long-running processes or high <span class="No-Break">computational requirements</span></li>
				<li>Workloads that require low-latency responses or have strict <span class="No-Break">performance requirements</span></li>
				<li>Applications with complex or stateful workflows that require maintaining <span class="No-Break">server state</span></li>
				<li>Scenarios where you need complete control over the underlying infrastructure and <span class="No-Break">operating system</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>When deciding whether to use serverless, it’s crucial to evaluate your specific application requirements, scalability needs, and cost considerations. Serverless can offer significant benefits in terms of scalability, cost efficiency, and development agility, but it’s important to carefully assess whether it aligns with your application’s characteristics <span class="No-Break">and goals.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-208"><a id="_idTextAnchor237"/>Adapting Java’s concurrency model to serverless environments</h1>
			<p>Serverless computing<a id="_idIndexMarker838"/> presents unique challenges for Java’s traditional concurrency model. The ephemeral and stateless nature of serverless functions necessitates a shift from long-lived <a id="_idIndexMarker839"/>thread pools and shared mutable state to more dynamic and isolated concurrency patterns. In this context, developers must focus on designing concurrency strategies that align with the short-lived, event-driven nature of <span class="No-Break">serverless architectures.</span></p>
			<p>Effective serverless concurrency in Java revolves around maximizing function efficiency within strict time and resource constraints. This involves leveraging asynchronous operations, particularly through CompletableFuture, to handle non-blocking I/O tasks and optimize throughput. Developers should structure their code to process events efficiently, a central tenet of <span class="No-Break">serverless design.</span></p>
			<p>When using<a id="_idIndexMarker840"/> CompletableFuture for asynchronous processing in serverless functions, it’s crucial to consider the<a id="_idIndexMarker841"/> function’s execution <span class="No-Break">time limits.</span></p>
			<p>Here’s <span class="No-Break">an example:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
public class ServerlessAsyncFunction implements RequestHandler&lt;APIGatewayProxyRequestEvent, APIGatewayProxyResponseEvent&gt; {
    @Override
    public APIGatewayProxyResponseEvent handleRequest(APIGatewayProxyRequestEvent input, Context context) {
        CompletableFuture&lt;String&gt; dbFuture = CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(this::queryDatabase);
        CompletableFuture&lt;String&gt; apiFuture = CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(this::callExternalAPI);
        try {
            String result = CompletableFuture.allOf(
                dbFuture, apiFuture)
                .thenApply(v -&gt; processResults(
                    dbFuture.join(), apiFuture.join()))
                .get(context.getRemainingTimeInMillis(),
                    TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS);
            return new APIGatewayProxyResponseEvent(
                ).withStatusCode(200).withBody(result);
        } catch (TimeoutException e) {
            return new APIGatewayProxyResponseEvent(
                ).withStatusCode(408).withBody(
                    "Request timed out");
        } catch (Exception e) {

    private String queryDatabase() {
        // Database query logic
        return "Database result";
    }
    private String callExternalAPI() {
        // API call logic
        return "API result";
    }
    private String processResults(String dbResult, String
        apiResult) {
        // Processing logic
        return "Processed result: " + dbResult + ",
             " + apiResult;
    }
}</pre>			<p>This demo showcases <a id="_idIndexMarker842"/>how to use <strong class="source-inline">CompletableFuture</strong> for asynchronous processing in a serverless function. By performing database queries and API calls concurrently, the function minimizes<a id="_idIndexMarker843"/> the overall execution time and improves responsiveness. This is particularly beneficial in serverless environments where reducing execution time can lead to cost reduction and <span class="No-Break">better scalability.</span></p>
			<p>For data <a id="_idIndexMarker844"/>processing, while parallel streams can be beneficial, it’s important to consider the trade-offs in a <span class="No-Break">serverless context:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
public class DataProcessingLambda implements RequestHandler&lt;List&lt;Data&gt;, List&lt;ProcessedData&gt;&gt; {
    @Override
    public List&lt;ProcessedData&gt; handleRequest(
        List&lt;Data&gt; dataList, Context context) {
            LambdaLogger logger = context.getLogger();
            logger.log("Starting data processing");
  // Use parallel stream only if the data size justifies it
            boolean useParallel = dataList.size() &gt; 100;
// Adjust threshold based on your specific use case

        return processedDataList;
    }
    private ProcessedData processDataItem(Data data) {
        // Ensure this method is thread-safe and efficient
        return new ProcessedData(data);
    }
}</pre>			<p>This <a id="_idIndexMarker845"/>demo illustrates the use of Java’s parallel streams to process large datasets in a serverless function. By conditionally using parallel streams based on the data size, the function can efficiently utilize multiple CPU cores to process data concurrently. This approach significantly enhances<a id="_idIndexMarker846"/> performance for large datasets, making the function more scalable and responsive in <span class="No-Break">serverless environments.</span></p>
			<p>As serverless computing continues to gain popularity, Java’s concurrency features will play a crucial role in enabling developers to build scalable, responsive, and high-performance serverless applications. To further optimize Java serverless applications, let’s explore best practices in design and the use of frameworks <span class="No-Break">and libraries.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-209"><a id="_idTextAnchor238"/>Designing efficient Java serverless applications</h2>
			<p>To ensure <a id="_idIndexMarker847"/>optimal performance and cost-efficiency in Java serverless applications, it’s crucial to follow best practices in design and leverage appropriate frameworks and libraries. Here are the key guidelines <span class="No-Break">and recommendations:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Minimizing cold starts</strong>: Cold starts occur when a new instance of a serverless function is provisioned. To reduce cold start times, developers can employ <span class="No-Break">several techniques:</span><ul><li><strong class="bold">AWS Lambda SnapStart</strong>: SnapStart optimizes the initialization process by taking a snapshot of the initialized execution environment and restoring it when needed, significantly reducing cold start latency. To use SnapStart, enable it in your Lambda function configuration and ensure your code is compatible <span class="No-Break">with serialization.</span></li><li><strong class="bold">Enable provisioned concurrency</strong>: This feature keeps functions warm by pre-initializing instances, ensuring quick response times. Set up provisioned concurrency in your Lambda function settings based on expected <span class="No-Break">traffic patterns.</span></li><li><strong class="bold">Optimize Java Virtual Machine runtime with custom images</strong>: Tools such as GraalVM Native Image can compile Java applications into native executables, reducing <a id="_idIndexMarker848"/>startup time and memory consumption. To use custom images, do <span class="No-Break">the following:</span><ul><li>Build your application using GraalVM <span class="No-Break">Native Image.</span></li><li>Create a custom Lambda runtime using AWS Lambda Runtime <span class="No-Break">Interface Client.</span></li><li>Package your native executable with the <span class="No-Break">custom runtime.</span></li><li>Deploy the package as a <span class="No-Break">Lambda function.</span></li></ul></li></ul></li>
				<li><span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">Additional optimizations</strong></span><span class="No-Break">:</span><ul><li>Minimize dependencies in your function to reduce <span class="No-Break">package size</span></li><li>Use lazy loading for <span class="No-Break">non-essential resources</span></li><li>Implement caching strategies for frequently <span class="No-Break">accessed data</span></li><li>Optimize your code for quick startup, moving initialization logic out of the handler method <span class="No-Break">where possible</span></li></ul></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Efficient memory and </strong><span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">resource management</strong></span><span class="No-Break">:</span><ul><li><strong class="bold">Right-size function memory</strong>: Allocate sufficient memory to avoid performance bottlenecks while being mindful <span class="No-Break">of costs.</span></li><li><strong class="bold">Optimize code execution</strong>: Write efficient code to reduce execution time, avoiding heavy initialization logic within the <span class="No-Break">function handler.</span></li><li><strong class="bold">Connection pooling</strong>: Use Amazon RDS Proxy for managing database connections effectively, as traditional connection pooling libraries such as HikariCP are not <a id="_idIndexMarker849"/>recommended for <span class="No-Break">serverless use.</span></li></ul></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Stateless design</strong>: Design functions to be stateless to ensure scalability and avoid state management issues. Use external storage services such as Amazon <strong class="bold">Simple Storage Service</strong> (<strong class="bold">S3</strong>), DynamoDB, or Redis for <span class="No-Break">state persistence.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Efficient </strong><span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">data handling</strong></span><span class="No-Break">:</span><ul><li><strong class="bold">Use streams for large data</strong>: Stream processing helps to handle large datasets without loading all data into memory. Java’s Stream API is useful for <span class="No-Break">this purpose.</span></li><li><strong class="bold">Optimize serializations</strong>: Use efficient serialization libraries such as Jackson for JSON processing and optimize <span class="No-Break">serialization/deserialization processes.</span></li></ul></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Monitoring </strong><span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">and logging</strong></span><span class="No-Break">:</span><ul><li><strong class="bold">Integrated logging</strong>: Use centralized logging services such as AWS CloudWatch Logs and structure logs for easy tracing <span class="No-Break">and debugging.</span></li><li><strong class="bold">Performance monitoring</strong>: Tools such as AWS X-Ray are helpful for tracing and monitoring the performance of <span class="No-Break">serverless functions.</span></li></ul></li>
			</ul>
			<h3>Java-specific optimization techniques for AWS Lambda</h3>
			<p>For<a id="_idIndexMarker850"/> Java developers working with <a id="_idIndexMarker851"/>AWS Lambda, there are various techniques available to optimize the runtime performance of your functions. These techniques can help you minimize cold start times, reduce memory usage, and improve overall <span class="No-Break">execution speed:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Application class data sharing (AppCDS)</strong>: Improves startup time and memory footprint by saving the metadata of loaded classes into an archive file, which can <a id="_idIndexMarker852"/>be memory-mapped<a id="_idIndexMarker853"/> during subsequent <span class="No-Break">JVM startups</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Optimizing JVM settings</strong>: Adjust JVM parameters, such as using <strong class="source-inline">-XX:+TieredCompilation -XX:TieredStopAtLevel=1</strong>, to balance startup time and <span class="No-Break">long-term performance</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Leveraging GraalVM native image</strong>: Compiling your Java application into a native executable can significantly reduce cold start times and <span class="No-Break">memory usage</span></li>
			</ul>
			<h3>Frameworks and libraries</h3>
			<p><strong class="bold">Spring Cloud Function</strong> simplifies <a id="_idIndexMarker854"/>serverless development by enabling developers to write cloud-agnostic functions using standard Java interfaces and Spring annotations. This allows for local creation, testing, and deployment, followed by seamless execution on various cloud infrastructures without code modifications. It supports an event-driven architecture, handling triggers such as HTTP requests, message queues, and timers, while its auto-discovery and registration of functions streamline the <span class="No-Break">development process.</span></p>
			<p>To illustrate, consider a simple Spring <span class="No-Break">Boot application:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
@SpringBootApplication
public class SpringFunctionApp {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(
            SpringFunctionApp.class, args);
    }    @Bean
    public Function&lt;String, String&gt; uppercase() {
        return value -&gt; value.toUpperCase();
    }}</pre>			<p>Within this <a id="_idIndexMarker855"/>Spring Boot application, Spring Cloud Function automatically registers the <strong class="source-inline">uppercase()</strong> method as a function. When triggered, Spring Cloud Function maps incoming requests to the corresponding function, executes it with the provided input, and returns the result. This abstraction layer allows for seamless deployment across diverse serverless environments, freeing developers to focus solely on <span class="No-Break">business logic.</span></p>
			<p><strong class="bold">Micronaut</strong>, renowned<a id="_idIndexMarker856"/> for its fast startup times and minimal memory footprint, presents an ideal choice for building serverless functions. Designed for creating lightweight and modular JVM-based applications, Micronaut seamlessly integrates with popular <span class="No-Break">serverless platforms.</span></p>
			<p>Let’s take a look at a simple <span class="No-Break">Micronaut function:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
@FunctionBean("helloFunction")
public class HelloFunction extends FunctionInitializer implements Function&lt;APIGatewayV2HTTPEvent, APIGatewayV2HTTPResponse&gt; {
    @Override
    public APIGatewayV2HTTPResponse apply(
        APIGatewayV2HTTPEvent request) {
            return APIGatewayV2HTTPResponse.builder()
                    .withStatusCode(200)
                    .withBody("Hello World")
                    .build();
        }}</pre>			<p>In this code, the <strong class="source-inline">@FunctionBean("helloFunction")</strong> annotation designates the <strong class="source-inline">HelloFunction</strong> class as a Micronaut function bean. The <strong class="source-inline">HelloFunction</strong> class extends <strong class="source-inline">FunctionInitializer</strong> and implements the Function interface, specifically for processing API Gateway HTTP <span class="No-Break">events (</span><span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">APIGatewayV2HTTPEvent</strong></span><span class="No-Break">).</span></p>
			<p>The overridden <strong class="source-inline">apply()</strong> method efficiently handles incoming requests, returning an <strong class="source-inline">APIGatewayV2HTTPResponse</strong> with a status code of 200 and the message <strong class="source-inline">"Hello World"</strong> in the body. This <a id="_idIndexMarker857"/>setup allows for easy deployment of the function to various serverless platforms, including <span class="No-Break">AWS Lambda.</span></p>
			<p><strong class="bold">Quarkus</strong>, known for its<a id="_idIndexMarker858"/> developer-friendly experience and exceptional performance, is a Kubernetes-native Java framework optimized for both <strong class="source-inline">GraalVM</strong> and <strong class="source-inline">OpenJDK HotSpot</strong>. Its design prioritizes fast boot times and low memory consumption, making it a compelling choice for <span class="No-Break">serverless applications.</span></p>
			<p>Let’s look at a basic <span class="No-Break">Quarkus function:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
public class GreetingLambda {
    public APIGatewayProxyResponseEvent handleRequest(
        APIGatewayProxyRequestEvent input) {
            return new APIGatewayProxyResponseEvent()
                .withStatusCode(200)

			<h1 id="_idParaDest-210"><a id="_idTextAnchor239"/>Introducing serverless frameworks and services – AWS SAM, Azure Functions Core Tools, Google Cloud Functions, and Oracle Functions</h1>
			<p>To effectively manage and deploy serverless applications across different cloud platforms, it is crucial to understand the frameworks provided by AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud. These frameworks simplify the process of defining, deploying, and managing serverless resources, making it easier for developers to build and maintain <span class="No-Break">scalable applications.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-211"><a id="_idTextAnchor240"/>AWS Serverless Application Model</h2>
			<p>AWS <strong class="bold">Serverless Application Model</strong> (<strong class="bold">SAM</strong>) is a framework for building serverless applications<a id="_idIndexMarker862"/> on AWS. It extends AWS CloudFormation to provide a simplified way of defining serverless resources such as AWS Lambda functions, API Gateway APIs, DynamoDB tables, and more. This is illustrated in <span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Figure 9</em></span><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">.1</em></span><span class="No-Break">:</span></p>

			<p>The AWS SAM framework diagram illustrates the interactions and components involved in a typical serverless <a id="_idIndexMarker863"/>architecture using AWS services. Here’s a breakdown of the <span class="No-Break">key components:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">AWS Lambda</strong>: A serverless computing service. It lets you run code without provisioning or <span class="No-Break">managing servers.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Amazon API Gateway</strong>: A fully managed service that allows you to create HTTP APIs that act as the front door for your serverless applications. Clients can invoke your Lambda functions through <span class="No-Break">these APIs.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Events</strong>: Events trigger the execution of your Lambda functions. These events can originate from <span class="No-Break">different sources:</span><ul><li>HTTP requests via <span class="No-Break">API Gateway</span></li><li>Changes in data sources such as S3 buckets or <span class="No-Break">DynamoDB tables</span></li><li>Scheduled triggers based <span class="No-Break">on time</span></li></ul></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Amazon DynamoDB</strong>: A NoSQL database service for storing and retrieving data at any scale. Your Lambda functions can interact with Amazon DynamoDB to store or <span class="No-Break">retrieve data.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Amazon S3</strong>: A scalable object storage service. Your Lambda functions can interact with Amazon S3 to store or <span class="No-Break">retrieve files.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Amazon SNS/SQSimple</strong>: <strong class="bold">Simple Notification Service</strong> (<strong class="bold">SNS</strong>) is a pub/sub messaging <a id="_idIndexMarker864"/>service, while <strong class="bold">Simple Queue Service</strong> (<strong class="bold">SQS</strong>) is a<a id="_idIndexMarker865"/> message queuing service. Your Lambda functions can use SNS to publish messages to SQS queues or subscribe to receive messages <span class="No-Break">from them.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">AWS Step Functions</strong>: A service for orchestrating workflows made up of multiple Lambda functions. It allows you to define the order of execution and <span class="No-Break">handle errors.</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p><span class="No-Break">Figure</span><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic"> 9</em></span><em class="italic">.1</em> depicts a serverless application on AWS built with the AWS SAM framework. Users initiate interactions through an API Gateway endpoint, which then directs those requests to AWS Lambda functions. These Lambda functions can access and process data from various sources such as DynamoDB (database), S3 (storage), SNS (messaging), and SQS (queuing). Optionally, AWS Step Functions can be used to orchestrate complex workflows involving multiple Lambda functions. By leveraging AWS SAM and its templates, developers can create scalable and cost-effective serverless applications <span class="No-Break">on AWS.</span></p>
			<p>SAM also allows<a id="_idIndexMarker866"/> for local testing of Lambda functions. This is a valuable feature that can help developers to debug and troubleshoot their code before deploying it to production. There are two ways to test Lambda functions locally: using AWS Toolkits or running AWS SAM in debug mode. AWS Toolkits are IDE plugins that allow you to set breakpoints, inspect variables, and execute code one line at a time. SAM also allows you to run AWS SAM in debug mode to attach to third-party debuggers such as ptvsd <span class="No-Break">or Delve.</span></p>

			<p>In our case, we’ll create a <a id="_idIndexMarker898"/>Cognito user pool (<strong class="source-inline">CognitoUserPool</strong>).

			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">User management</strong>: Create, read, update, and delete <span class="No-Break">user profiles</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Authentication</strong>: Verify user credentials and issue secure tokens (e.g., JWTs) <span class="No-Break">for access</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Security</strong>: Enforce password policies, multi-factor authentication (MFA), and other <span class="No-Break">security measures</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Authorization</strong>: Define fine-grained access controls based on user attributes <span class="No-Break">or groups</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Federation</strong>: Integrate with external identity providers such as Facebook, Google, or enterprise <span class="No-Break">identity systems</span></li>

			<p>Deploy<a id="_idIndexMarker908"/> the Java code and the CloudFormation stack (prepare your environment). Ensure you have an AWS account and the necessary permissions to create resources such as DynamoDB tables, API Gateway, Lambda functions, IAM roles, and <span class="No-Break">so on.</span></p>
			<p>Install and configure the AWS CLI if you haven’t already. Instructions can be found <span class="No-Break">at </span><a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-configure.html"><span class="No-Break">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-configure.html</span></a><span class="No-Break">.</span></p>
			<p>Package your Lambda function code into JAR files and upload them to an S3 bucket. Note that the S3 bucket name and the keys (paths) where the JAR files are stored. You’ll need these when running the <span class="No-Break">CloudFormation script.</span></p>

			<h1 id="_idParaDest-221"><a id="_idTextAnchor253"/>Summary</h1>
			<p>In this chapter, we explored serverless computing and its integration with Java’s concurrency capabilities. We examined the core concepts of serverless architectures, including event-driven processing, statelessness, and automatic scaling, along with their advantages and potential drawbacks. Understanding these concepts is crucial for effectively leveraging serverless computing in <span class="No-Break">your applications.</span></p>
			<p>We discussed adapting Java’s concurrency model to serverless environments, focusing on tools such as CompletableFuture and parallel streams. We highlighted the best practices for Java serverless applications, including strategies for minimizing cold starts, efficient resource management, and leveraging frameworks such as Spring Cloud Function, Micronaut, <span class="No-Break">and Quarkus.</span></p>
			<p>The chapter introduced major serverless platforms such as AWS SAM, Azure Functions Core Tools, Google Cloud Functions, and Oracle Functions, highlighting their unique features and how they simplify the development and deployment of serverless applications. We explored Java-specific optimization techniques to enhance performance and reduce latency in <span class="No-Break">serverless environments.</span></p>
			<p>Through real-world examples from companies such as Airbnb, LinkedIn, and Expedia, we saw practical applications of serverless architectures and concurrency management. These case studies illustrated how industry leaders leverage serverless solutions to achieve scalability, efficiency, and enhanced <span class="No-Break">user experiences.</span></p>
			<p>Finally, we provided a hands-on example of building a travel booking application using AWS SAM, demonstrating how to integrate various AWS services and orchestrate workflows using AWS Step Functions. This practical approach equipped you with the knowledge to deploy and manage serverless <span class="No-Break">applications effectively.</span></p>
			<p>By the end of this chapter, you should be well-equipped to leverage Java’s concurrency features in serverless environments, apply optimization best practices, and make informed decisions about using serverless architectures in <span class="No-Break">your projects.</span></p>
			<p>As we transition from serverless architectures to broader cloud computing paradigms, our next chapter will explore another crucial aspect of modern application development: auto-scaling. <a href="B20937_10.xhtml#_idTextAnchor256"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 10</em></span></a> will delve into synchronizing Java’s concurrency models with cloud auto-scaling dynamics, building upon the concurrent programming concepts we’ve discussed and applying them to the elastic nature of cloud environments. This knowledge will be essential for developers looking to create robust, scalable Java applications that can efficiently adapt to varying workloads in <span class="No-Break">cloud platforms.</span></p>
