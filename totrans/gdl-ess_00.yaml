- en: When I first came across Gradle in 2011, it was a young yet powerful tool. If
    I remember correctly, the version was 0.9\. It was difficult for me to get started
    despite Gradle having an adequate official documentation. What I missed the most
    was a guide that would just help me understand the core concepts first, without
    having to go through the entire documentation.

- en: Gradle is a fantastic build tool. There is so much to learn about it that new
    users are often clueless about where to start. It is unwise to expect an application
    developer to go through the entire Gradle reference material just to understand
    the basics.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This book attempts to help a reader get started with Gradle by revealing the
    key concepts in a step-by-step manner. It introduces a more advanced topic succinctly.
    This book focuses on the practical usage of Gradle that a reader can immediately
    put to use on his or her project. This book strives to stay true to the spirit
    of 'essentials' by avoiding going into every possible feature and option that
    Gradle has to offer. Code samples for applications have been consciously kept
    very small in order to avoid distractions from application logic.

- en: This book is a quick start guide for Gradle. If you are a Java developer already
    building your code with Ant or Maven and want to switch to Gradle, this book helps
    you to quickly understand the different concepts of Gradle. Even if you do not
    have exposure to other build tools such as Ant or Maven, you can start afresh
    on Gradle with the help of this book. It starts with the basics of Gradle and
    then gently moves to concepts such as multimodule projects, migration strategies,
    testing strategies, Continuous Integration, and code coverage with the help of
    Gradle.

    "Chapter 3. Building a Web Application"), *Building a Web Application*. This section
    introduces the basics of Gradle, with very simple examples, which helps readers
    to create build files for Java projects and Web applications. It gives a gentle
    start without involving any complex concepts.

    Build"), *Multiprojects Build*. This section helps the reader to understand the
    underpinning of Gradle in more depth, still maintaining the 'essentials' aspect
    of this book. It also helps the reader to understand how to interpret and write
    scripts that conform to Gradle DSL.

    Projects"), *Polyglot Projects*. This section covers more real-world use cases
    that Gradle users come across. Some examples include migrating to Gradle from
    the existing build system, using Gradle on CI servers, maintaining code quality
    with Gradle, using Gradle to build project languages such as Groovy and Scala,
    and so on. These concepts mostly revolve around what various plugins have to offer
    and also allows the reader to create their own custom plugins.
