<html><head></head><body><div class="preface" title="Preface"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="pref05"/>Preface</h1></div></div></div><p>jBPM is a leading open source BPM and workflow platform whose development is sponsored by Red Hat under Apache Software License (ASL) licensing. The jBPM product has been around for almost 10 years; its strongest points rely on flexibility, extensibility, and lightness, and it is a modular, cross-platform pure Java engine that is BPMN2 compliant.</p><p>It features a robust management console and development tools that support the user during the business process life cycle: development, deployment, and versioning. It integrates with widely-adopted frameworks and technologies (SOAP, REST, Spring, Java EE CDI, and OSGi) and provides off-the-shelf support to Git and Maven.</p><p>It fits into different system architectures and can be deployed as a full-fledged web application or as a service; it can be tightly embedded into a classical desktop application or loosely integrated into a complex event-driven architecture. In its default configuration, jBPM can be hosted by the enterprise class application server Red Hat EAP 6.x or the bleeding-edge Red Hat WildFly 8 server.</p><p>
<span class="emphasis"><em>Mastering JBPM6</em></span> takes you through a practical approach to using and extending jBPM 6.2. This book provides a detailed jBPM 6.2 overview; it covers the BPM notation supported by the engine and explains the advanced engine and API topics focusing, as much as possible, on several working practical examples.</p><p>The book presents the user with solutions to common real-time issues like BAM (which stands for business activity monitoring) and production scenarios.</p><div class="section" title="What this book covers"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl1sec02"/>What this book covers</h1></div></div></div><p>

JDK 6 or newer versions can be downloaded from <a class="ulink" href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html">http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html</a>. There are installation instructions on this page as well. To verify that your installation was successful, run <code class="literal">java –version</code> on the command line.</p><p>Download <code class="literal">jbpm-6.2.0.Final-installer-full.zip</code> from <a class="ulink" href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/jbpm/files/jBPM%206/jbpm-6.2.0.Final/">http://sourceforge.net/projects/jbpm/files/jBPM%206/jbpm-6.2.0.Final/</a>.
