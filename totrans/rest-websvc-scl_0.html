With Scala, you're able to write beautiful, concise, and easily maintainable code in a highly productive manner. Scala also provides very useful language constructs for creating REST services. In the Scala ecosystem, there is a large number of REST frameworks and each one of them allows you to create such services in a slightly different manner. This book gives you an overview of five of the most mature and flexible REST frameworks available, and shows you, through extensive examples, how you can use the various features of these frameworks.</p><div class="book" title="What this book covers"><div class="book"><div class="book"><div class="book"><div class="calibre12" id="calibre_pb_1"/>

It also gives some background information on REST and the model we'll use throughout the book.</p><p class="calibre7"><a class="calibre1" title="Chapter 2. A Functional-style REST Service with Finagle and Finch" href="part0021_split_000.html#page">Chapter 2</a>, <span class="strong"><em class="calibre9">A Functional-style REST Service with Finagle and Finch</em></span>, explains how you can use the Finch library together with Finagle to create a REST service that follows a functional programming approach.</p><p class="calibre7"><a class="calibre1" title="Chapter 3. A Pattern-matching Approach to REST Services with Unfiltered" href="part0028_split_000.html#page">Chapter 3</a>, <span class="strong"><em class="calibre9">A Pattern-matching Approach to REST Services with Unfiltered</em></span>, shows how you can use Unfiltered, a small REST library, to create a REST service. With Unfiltered, you can fully control how your HTTP request and responses are processed.</p><p class="calibre7"><a class="calibre1" title="Chapter 4. An Easy REST Service Using Scalatra" href="part0034_split_000.html#page">Chapter 4</a>, <span class="strong"><em class="calibre9">An Easy REST Service using Scalatra</em></span>, uses a part of the Scalatra framework to create a simple REST service. Scalatra is a great intuitive Scala framework, which makes creating REST services very easy.</p><p class="calibre7"><a class="calibre1" title="Chapter 5. Defining a REST Service Using Akka HTTP DSL" href="part0040_split_000.html#page">Chapter 5</a>, <span class="strong"><em class="calibre9">Defining a REST Service Using Akka HTTP DSL</em></span>, focuses on the DSL part of Akka HTTP and explains how you can use the DSL, which is based on the well-known Spray DSL, to create easily composable REST services.</p><p class="calibre7"><a class="calibre1" title="Chapter 6. Creating REST Services with the Play 2 Framework" href="part0047_split_000.html#page">Chapter 6</a>, <span class="strong"><em class="calibre9">Creating REST Services with the Play 2 Framework</em></span>, explains how you can use part of the well-known Play 2 web framework to create a REST service.</p><p class="calibre7"><a class="calibre1" title="Chapter 7. JSON, HATEOAS, and Documentation" href="part0053_split_000.html#page">Chapter 7</a>, <span class="strong"><em class="calibre9">JSON, HATEOAS, and Documentation</em></span>, goes deeper into the two important aspects of REST—JSON and HATEOAS. This chapter shows you, through examples, how to work with JSON and incorporate HATEOAS into the discussed frameworks.</p></div></div>
