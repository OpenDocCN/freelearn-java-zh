- en: This book is structured into three distinct yet interconnected parts, each aimed
    at providing in-depth knowledge and practical skills to enhance your proficiency
    in Java concurrency. *Part 1* lays the groundwork by introducing the fundamental
    principles of concurrency and parallelism, essential for any modern software development.
    This section covers the basics of Java concurrency, including threads and processes,
    and delves into advanced topics such as the `java.util.concurrent` package, the
    Fork/Join framework, and parallel streams. It also explores practical implementation
    strategies and concurrency patterns tailored for cloud environments, equipping
    you with the foundational tools needed to tackle the unique challenges of cloud-native
    Java applications.

- en: '*Part 2* builds on the foundational knowledge from *Part 1*, focusing on how
    Java’s concurrency capabilities address complex challenges across various specialized
    domains. This part examines Java’s role in big data, machine learning, microservices,
    and serverless computing. Through practical examples, code snippets, and real-world
    use cases, it demonstrates how to harness Java’s concurrency features to build
    scalable, high-performance applications in these cutting-edge fields.'

    to the advanced realm of cloud computing. It covers synchronization with cloud
    auto-scaling, and advanced concurrency practices and explores emerging trends
    such as edge computing and quantum computing. This section prepares you to leverage
    Java’s concurrency capabilities to their fullest potential, enabling you to stay
    at the forefront of technological advancements in cloud computing.'
