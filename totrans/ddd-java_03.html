			<p class="author-quote">“We won’t be distracted by comparison if we are captivated with purpose.” </p>
			<p class="author-quote">– Bob Goff </p>
			<p>Software architecture refers to the fundamental structures of a software system and the discipline of creating such structures and systems. Over the years, we have accumulated a series of architecture styles and programming paradigms to help us deal with system complexity.</p>
			<p>In this chapter, we will examine how <strong class="bold">Domain-Driven Design</strong> (<strong class="bold">DDD</strong>) can be applied in a manner that is complementary to these architecture styles and programming paradigms. We will also look at how/where it fits in the overall scheme of things when crafting a software solution.</p>
			<p>In this chapter, we will cover the following topics:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Architecture styles</li>
				<li>Programming paradigms</li>
				<li>Which paradigm should you choose?</li>
			</ul>
			<p>By the end of this chapter, you will have gained an appreciation of a variety of architecture styles and programming paradigms, along with some pitfalls to watch out for when applying them. You will also understand the role that DDD plays in augmenting each of these.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-39"><a id="_idTextAnchor038"/>Architecture styles</h1>
			<p>Domain-driven design <a id="_idIndexMarker124"/>presents a set of architecture tenets in the form of strategic and tactical design elements. This enables you to decompose large, potentially unwieldy business subdomains into well-factored, independent bounded contexts. </p>
			<p>One of the great advantages of DDD is that it does not require the use of any specific architecture. However, the <a id="_idIndexMarker125"/>software industry has been using a plethora of architecture styles over the last few years. Let’s look at how DDD can be used in conjunction with a set of popular architecture styles to arrive at better solutions.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-40"><a id="_idTextAnchor039"/>Layered architecture</h2>
			<p><strong class="bold">Layered architecture</strong> is one <a id="_idIndexMarker126"/>of the most common <a id="_idIndexMarker127"/>architecture styles, where the solution is typically organized into four broad categories: <strong class="bold">presentation</strong>, <strong class="bold">application</strong>, <strong class="bold">domain</strong>, and <strong class="bold">persistence</strong>. Each of the layers provides a solution to a particular concern it represents, as shown here:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer039" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B16716_Figure_2.1.jpg" alt="Figure 2.1 – The essence of layered architecture&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 2.1 – The essence of layered architecture</p>
			<p>The main idea behind layered architecture is a separation of concerns – where the dependencies between layers are unidirectional (from top to bottom). For example, the domain layer can <a id="_idIndexMarker128"/>depend on the persistence layer, not <a id="_idIndexMarker129"/>the other way round. In addition, any given layer typically accesses the layer immediately beneath it without bypassing layers in between. For example, the presentation layer may access the domain layer only through the application layer.</p>
			<p>This structure enables looser coupling between layers and allows them to evolve independently of each other. The idea of layered architecture fits very well with DDD’s tactical design elements, as depicted here:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer040" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B16716_Figure_2.2.jpg" alt="Figure 2.2 – Layered architecture mapped to DDD’s tactical design elements&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 2.2 – Layered architecture mapped to DDD’s tactical design elements</p>
			<p>DDD actively promotes the use of a layered architecture, primarily because it makes it possible to focus on the domain layer in isolation from other concerns, such as how information gets displayed, how end-to-end flows are managed, and how data is stored and retrieved. From that perspective, solutions that apply DDD naturally tend to be layered as well.</p>
			<h3>Notable variations</h3>
			<p>A variation of layered <a id="_idIndexMarker130"/>architecture was invented by Alistair <a id="_idIndexMarker131"/>Cockburn, which he originally called hexagonal architecture (<a href="https://alistair.cockburn.us/hexagonal-architecture/">https://alistair.cockburn.us/hexagonal-architecture/</a>), alternatively called <a id="_idIndexMarker132"/>ports and adapters architecture. The idea behind this style was to avoid inadvertent dependencies between layers (which could occur in layered architecture), specifically between the core of a system and the peripheral layers.</p>
			<p>The main idea here is to make use of interfaces (<strong class="bold">ports</strong>) exclusively within the core to enable modern <a id="_idIndexMarker133"/>drivers, such as testing and looser coupling. This allows the core to be developed and evolved independently of the non-core parts and the external dependencies. Integration with real-world components such as databases, filesystems, and web services is achieved <a id="_idIndexMarker134"/>through concrete implementations of the ports (<strong class="bold">adapters</strong>). The use of interfaces within the core enables much <a id="_idIndexMarker135"/>easier testing of the core in isolation from the rest of the system, using mocks and stubs. It is also common to use dependency injection frameworks to dynamically swap out implementations of these interfaces when working with a real system in an end-to-end environment. A visual representation of hexagonal architecture is shown here:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer041" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B16716_Figure_2.3.jpg" alt="Figure 2.3 – Hexagonal architecture&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 2.3 – Hexagonal architecture</p>
			<p>It turns out that the <a id="_idIndexMarker136"/>use of the term <em class="italic">hexagon</em> in this context was purely for visual purposes– not to limit the system to exactly six types of ports.</p>
			<p>Similar to the <a id="_idIndexMarker137"/>hexagonal architecture, onion architecture (<a href="https://jeffreypalermo.com/2008/07/the-onion-architecture-part-1/">https://jeffreypalermo.com/2008/07/the-onion-architecture-part-1/</a>), conceived by Jeffrey Palermo, is based on creating an application based on an independent object model within the <a id="_idIndexMarker138"/>core that can be compiled and run separately from the outer layers. This is done by defining interfaces (<em class="italic">ports</em> in hexagonal architecture) in the core and implementing them (<em class="italic">adapters</em> in hexagonal architecture) in the outer layers. From our perspective, the hexagonal and onion architecture styles have no perceptible differences that we could identify.</p>
			<p>A visual <a id="_idIndexMarker139"/>representation of onion architecture is shown here:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer042" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B16716_Figure_2.4.jpg" alt="Figure 2.4 – Onion architecture&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 2.4 – Onion architecture</p>
			<p>Yet another variation of layered architecture, popularized by Robert C. Martin (known endearingly as Uncle Bob), is clean architecture. This is based on adhering to the SOLID principles (<a href="https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2020/10/18/Solid-Relevance.html">https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2020/10/18/Solid-Relevance.html</a>), also conceived by him. The fundamental message here (just like in the case of hexagonal <a id="_idIndexMarker140"/>and onion architecture) is to avoid dependencies between the core – the one that houses business logic – and other layers that tend to be volatile (such as frameworks, third-party libraries, UIs, and databases).</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer043" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B16716_Figure_2.5.jpg" alt="Figure 2.5 – Clean architecture&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 2.5 – Clean architecture</p>
			<p>All these architecture <a id="_idIndexMarker141"/>styles are synergistic with DDD’s idea of developing <a id="_idIndexMarker142"/>a domain model for the core subdomain (and, by extension, its bounded context) independently of the rest of the system.</p>
			<p>While each of these architecture styles provides additional guidance in terms of how to structure a layered architecture, any architecture approach we choose comes with its set of trade-offs and limitations you will need to be cognizant of. We will discuss some of these considerations in the next sub-sections.</p>
			<h3>The layer cake anti-pattern</h3>
			<p>Sticking to a fixed set of layers provides a level of isolation, but in simpler cases, it may prove to be overkill without <a id="_idIndexMarker143"/>adding any perceptible benefit, other than adherence to the agreed-on architecture guidelines. In the layer cake anti-pattern, each layer merely proxies the call to the layer beneath it without adding any value. The following example illustrates this fairly common scenario:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer044" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B16716_Figure_2.6.jpg" alt="Figure 2.6 – An example of the layer cake anti-pattern to find an entity representation by ID&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 2.6 – An example of the layer cake anti-pattern to find an entity representation by ID</p>
			<p>Here, the <strong class="source-inline">findById</strong> method is replicated in every layer and simply calls the method with the same name in the layer below, with no additional logic. This introduces a level of accidental complexity <a id="_idIndexMarker144"/>to the solution. Some amount of redundancy in the layering may be unavoidable for the purposes of standardization. It may be best to reexamine the layering guidelines if the <em class="italic">layer cake</em> occurs prominently in the code base.</p>
			<h3>Anemic translation</h3>
			<p>Another variation <a id="_idIndexMarker145"/>of the layer cake we see commonly is one where layers refuse to share input and output types in the name of higher isolation and looser coupling. This makes it necessary to perform translations at the boundary of <a id="_idIndexMarker146"/>each layer. If the objects being translated are more or less structurally identical, we have an <strong class="bold">anemic translation</strong>. Let’s look at a variation of the <strong class="source-inline">findById</strong> example we discussed previously.</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer045" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B16716_Figure_2.7.jpg" alt="Figure 2.7 – An example of the anemic translation anti-pattern&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 2.7 – An example of the anemic translation anti-pattern</p>
			<p>In this case, each layer defines an <strong class="source-inline">Entity</strong> type of its own, requiring a translation between types at each layer. To make matters worse, the structure of the <strong class="source-inline">Entity</strong> type may have seemingly minor variations (for example, <strong class="source-inline">lastName</strong> being referred to as <strong class="source-inline">surname</strong>). While such translations may be necessary across bounded contexts, teams should strive to avoid the need for variations in names and structures of the same concept within a single bounded context. The intentional use of <em class="italic">ubiquitous language</em> helps avoid such scenarios.</p>
			<h3>Layer bypass</h3>
			<p>When working with a layered architecture, it is reasonable to start by being strict about layers only <a id="_idIndexMarker147"/>interacting with the layers immediately beneath them. As we saw earlier, such rigid enforcements may lead to an intolerable degree of accidental complexity, especially when applied generically to a large number of use cases. In such scenarios, it may be worth considering consciously allowing one or more layers to be bypassed.</p>
			<p>For example, the <strong class="source-inline">controller</strong> layer may be allowed to work directly with the <strong class="source-inline">repository</strong> without using the <strong class="source-inline">service</strong> layer. In many cases, we have found it useful to use a separate set of rules for <em class="italic">commands</em> versus <em class="italic">queries</em> as a starting point.</p>
			<p>This can be a slippery slope. To continue maintaining a level of sanity, teams should consider the use of a lightweight architecture governance tool such as <strong class="bold">ArchUnit</strong> (<a href="https://www.archunit.org/">https://www.archunit.org/</a>) to make agreements explicit and provide quick feedback. A simple example <a id="_idIndexMarker148"/>of how to use ArchUnit for this purpose is shown here:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer046" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/ch2-1.jpg" alt=""/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p>The <strong class="source-inline">Repository</strong> layer <a id="_idIndexMarker149"/>can be accessed by both the Services and Controllers layers – effectively allowing Controllers to bypass the use of the Services layer.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-41"><a id="_idTextAnchor040"/>Vertical slice architecture</h2>
			<p>Layered architecture and its variants provide reasonably good guidance on how to structure complex <a id="_idIndexMarker150"/>applications. Vertical slice <a id="_idIndexMarker151"/>architecture, championed by Jimmy Boggard, recognizes that it may be too rigid to adopt a standard layering strategy for all use cases across an entire application. </p>
			<p>Furthermore, it is important to note that business value cannot be derived by implementing any of these horizontal layers in isolation. Doing so will only result in unusable inventory and lots of unnecessary context switching until all these layers are connected. Therefore, vertical slice architecture proposes minimizing coupling between slices and maximizing <a id="_idIndexMarker152"/>coupling in a slice (<a href="https://jimmybogard.com/vertical-slice-architecture/">https://jimmybogard.com/vertical-slice-architecture/</a>), as shown here:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer047" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B16716_Figure_2.8.jpg" alt="Figure 2.8 – Vertical slice architecture&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 2.8 – Vertical slice architecture</p>
			<p>In this example, <strong class="bold">Place Order</strong> might require us to coordinate with other components through the application layer and apply complex business invariants, while operating within the purview of <a id="_idIndexMarker153"/>an ACID transaction. Similarly, <strong class="bold">Cancel Order</strong> might <a id="_idIndexMarker154"/>require applying business invariants within an ACID transaction without any additional coordination – obviating the need for the application layer, in this case. However, <strong class="bold">Search O</strong><strong class="bold">rders</strong> might require us to simply fetch existing data from a query-optimized view. This style makes use of a horses-for-courses approach to layering that may help alleviate some anti-patterns listed previously when implementing a plain vanilla layered architecture.</p>
			<h3>Considerations</h3>
			<p>Vertical slice architecture <a id="_idIndexMarker155"/>affords a lot of flexibility when implementing a solution – taking into consideration the specific needs of the use case being implemented. However, without some level of governance, this may quickly devolve into a big ball of mud, with layering decisions being made seemingly arbitrarily, based on personal preferences and experiences (or lack thereof). As a sensible default, you may want to consider using a distinct layering strategy for commands and queries. Beyond that, non-functional requirements may dictate how you may need to deviate from here. For example, you may need to bypass layers to meet performance SLAs for certain use cases.</p>
			<p>When used pragmatically, vertical slice architecture does enable you to apply DDD very effectively within <a id="_idIndexMarker156"/>each or a group of related vertical slices – allowing them to be treated as bounded contexts. Two possibilities using the place order and cancel order examples are shown here:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer048" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B16716_Figure_2.9.jpg" alt="Figure 2.9 – Vertical slices used to evolve bounded contexts&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 2.9 – Vertical slices used to evolve bounded contexts</p>
			<p>In the <strong class="bold">(i)</strong> example in the preceding diagram, place order and cancel order each use a distinct domain <a id="_idIndexMarker157"/>model, whereas in the <strong class="bold">(ii)</strong> example, both use cases share a common domain model and, by extension, become part of the same bounded context. This does pave the way to slice functionality when looking to adopt the serverless architecture along use case boundaries.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-42"><a id="_idTextAnchor041"/>Service-oriented architecture (SOA)</h2>
			<p><strong class="bold">Service-Oriented Architecture</strong> (<strong class="bold">SOA</strong>) is an architecture style where software components <a id="_idIndexMarker158"/>expose (potentially) reusable <a id="_idIndexMarker159"/>functionality over standardized interfaces. The use of standardized interfaces (such as SOAP, REST, and gRPC, to name a few) enables easier interoperability when integrating heterogeneous solutions, as shown here:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer049" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B16716_Figure_2.10.jpg" alt="Figure 2.10 – SOA – exposing reusable functionality over standard interfaces&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 2.10 – SOA – exposing reusable functionality over standard interfaces</p>
			<p>Previously, the use of non-standard, proprietary interfaces made this kind of integration a lot more challenging. For example, a retail bank may expose inter-account transfer functionality in the form of SOAP web services. While SOA prescribes exposing functionality <a id="_idIndexMarker160"/>over standardized interfaces, the focus is more on integrating heterogeneous applications than implementing them.</p>
			<h3>Considerations</h3>
			<p>At one of the banks <a id="_idIndexMarker161"/>we worked at, we exposed a set of over 500 service interfaces over SOAP. Under the hood, we implemented these services using EJB 2.x (a combination of stateless session beans and message-driven beans), hosted on a commercial J2EE application server, which also did double duty as an <strong class="bold">Enterprise Service Bus</strong> (<strong class="bold">ESB</strong>). These services delegated most, if <a id="_idIndexMarker162"/>not all, of the logic to a set of underlying stored procedures within a single monolithic Oracle database, using a canonical data model for the entire enterprise! To the outside world, these services were <em class="italic">location-transparent</em>, stateless, <em class="italic">composable</em>, and <em class="italic">discoverable</em>. Indeed, we advertised this implementation as an example of SOA, and it would be hard to argue that it was not.</p>
			<p>This suite of services had evolved organically over the years, with no explicit boundaries, concepts from various parts of the organization, and generations of people mixed in, each adding their own interpretation of how business functionality needed to be implemented. In essence, the implementation resembled the dreaded big ball of mud, which was extremely hard to enhance and maintain.</p>
			<p>The intentions behind SOA are noble. However, the promises of <em class="italic">reuse</em> and <em class="italic">loose coupling</em> are hard to achieve in practice, given the lack of concrete implementation guidance <a id="_idIndexMarker163"/>on component <a id="_idIndexMarker164"/>granularity. It is also true that SOA means many things (<a href="https://martinfowler.com/bliki/ServiceOrientedAmbiguity.html">https://martinfowler.com/bliki/ServiceOrientedAmbiguity.html</a>) to different people. This ambiguity leads to most SOA implementations becoming complex, unmaintainable monoliths, centered around technology components such as a service bus, a persistence store, or both. This is where using DDD to solve a complex problem by breaking it down into subdomains and bounded contexts can be invaluable.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-43"><a id="_idTextAnchor042"/>Microservices architecture</h2>
			<p>In the last decade or so, microservices have gained quite a lot of popularity, with lots of organizations wanting <a id="_idIndexMarker165"/>to adopt this style of architecture. In <a id="_idIndexMarker166"/>a lot of ways, microservices are an extension of SOA – one where much emphasis is placed on creating focused components that deal with doing a limited number of things and doing them right. Sam Newman, the author of the <em class="italic">Building Microservices</em> book, defines microservices as <em class="italic">small-sized</em>, independently deployable components that maintain their own state and are <em class="italic">modeled around a business domain</em>. This affords benefits such as adopting a <a id="_idIndexMarker167"/>horses-for-courses approach when modeling <a id="_idIndexMarker168"/>solutions, limiting the blast radius, improved productivity and speed, autonomous cross-functional teams, and so on.</p>
			<p>Microservices usually exist as a collective, working collaboratively to achieve desired business outcomes, as depicted here:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer050" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B16716_Figure_2.11.jpg" alt="Figure 2.11 – A microservices ecosystem&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 2.11 – A microservices ecosystem</p>
			<p>As we can see, SOA and microservices are very similar from the perspective of the consumers, in that they access functionality through a set of standardized interfaces. The microservices approach is an evolution of SOA in that the focus now is on building smaller, self-sufficient, independently deployable components with the intent of avoiding single <a id="_idIndexMarker169"/>points of failure (such as an enterprise database or service bus), which <a id="_idIndexMarker170"/>was fairly common with a number of SOA-based implementations.</p>
			<h3>Considerations</h3>
			<p>While microservices have definitely helped, there still exists quite a lot of ambiguity when it comes <a id="_idIndexMarker171"/>to answering how big or small <a id="_idIndexMarker172"/>a microservice should be (<a href="https://martinfowler.com/articles/microservices.html#HowBigIsAMicroservice">https://martinfowler.com/articles/microservices.html#HowBigIsAMicroservice</a>). Indeed, a lot of <a id="_idIndexMarker173"/>teams seem to struggle to get this balance right, resulting in a distributed monolith (<a href="https://www.infoq.com/news/2016/02/services-distributed-monolith/">https://www.infoq.com/news/2016/02/services-distributed-monolith/</a>), which, in a lot of ways, can be much worse than even a single-process monolith from the SOA days. Again, applying the strategic design concepts of DDD can help create independent, loosely coupled components, making it an ideal companion for the microservices style of architecture.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-44"><a id="_idTextAnchor043"/>Event-driven architecture (EDA)</h2>
			<p>Irrespective of the granularity of components (monolith, microservices, or something in between), most <a id="_idIndexMarker174"/>non-trivial solutions have a boundary, beyond which <a id="_idIndexMarker175"/>there may be a need to communicate with external system(s). This communication usually happens through the exchange of messages between systems, causing them to become coupled with each other. Coupling comes in two broad flavors: <em class="italic">afferent</em> – who depends on you, and <em class="italic">efferent</em> – who you <a id="_idIndexMarker176"/>depend on. Excessive amounts of efferent coupling can make systems very brittle and hard to work with.</p>
			<p>Event-driven systems enable authoring solutions that have a relatively low amount of efferent coupling by emitting events when they attain a certain state, without caring about who consumes <a id="_idIndexMarker177"/>those events. In this regard, it is important to <a id="_idIndexMarker178"/>differentiate between message-driven and event-driven systems, as mentioned in the <em class="italic">Reactive Manifesto</em>:</p>
			<p class="author-quote">“A message is an item of data that is sent to a specific destination. An event is a signal emitted by a component upon reaching a given state. In a message-driven system addressable recipients await the arrival of messages and react to them, otherwise lying dormant. In an event-driven system notification listeners are attached to the sources of events such that they are invoked when the event is emitted. This means that an event-driven system focuses on addressable event sources while a message-driven system concentrates on addressable recipients.” </p>
			<p class="author-quote">– The Reactive Manifesto</p>
			<p>In simpler terms, event-driven systems do not care who the downstream consumers are, whereas in a message-driven system, that may not necessarily be true. When we say event-driven in the context of this book, we mean the former.</p>
			<p>Typically, event-driven systems eliminate the need for point-to-point messaging with the ultimate <a id="_idIndexMarker179"/>consumers by making use of an intermediary <a id="_idIndexMarker180"/>infrastructure component, usually known as a message broker, event bus, and so on. This effectively reduces efferent coupling from <em class="italic">n</em> consumers to 1. There are a few variations on how event-driven systems can be implemented. In the context of publishing events, Martin Fowler talks about two broad styles (among other things),  event notifications and event-carried state transfer, in his <em class="italic">What do you mean by “Event-Driven”?</em> article (<a href="https://martinfowler.com/articles/201701-event-driven.html">https://martinfowler.com/articles/201701-event-driven.html</a>).</p>
			<h3>Considerations</h3>
			<p>One of the main trade-offs when building an event-driven system is to decide the amount of <a id="_idIndexMarker181"/>state (payload) that should be embedded in each event. It may be prudent to consider embedding just enough state to indicate changes that occurred as a result of the emitted event to keep the various opposing forces, such as producer scaling, encapsulation, consumer complexity, and resiliency. We will discuss the related implications in more detail when we cover implementing events in <a href="B16716_05_Final_NM_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor077"><em class="italic">Chapter 5</em></a>, <em class="italic">Implementing Domain Logic</em>.</p>
			<p>DDD is all about keeping complexity in check by creating these independent bounded contexts. However, <em class="italic">independent</em> does not mean <em class="italic">isolated</em>. Bounded contexts may still need to communicate with each other. One way to do that is through the use of a fundamental DDD building block – domain events. Event-driven architecture and DDD are thus complementary. It is typical to make use of an event-driven architecture to allow bounded contexts to communicate while continuing to loosely couple with each other.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-45"><a id="_idTextAnchor044"/>Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS)</h2>
			<p>In traditional applications, a single-domain, data/persistence model is used to handle all kinds of <a id="_idIndexMarker182"/>operations. With CQRS, we create <a id="_idIndexMarker183"/>distinct models to handle updates (commands) and <a id="_idIndexMarker184"/>inquiries. This is <a id="_idIndexMarker185"/>depicted in the following diagram:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer051" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B16716_Figure_2.12.jpg" alt="Figure 2.12 – Traditional versus CQRS architecture&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 2.12 – Traditional versus CQRS architecture</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Note</p>
			<p class="callout">We depict multiple query models in the previous diagram because it is possible (but not necessary) to create more than one query model, depending on the kinds of query use cases that need to be supported.</p>
			<p>For this to work <a id="_idIndexMarker186"/>predictably, the <a id="_idIndexMarker187"/>query model(s) need to be kept in sync with the write models (we will examine some of the techniques to do that in detail later).</p>
			<h3>Considerations</h3>
			<p>A traditional, single-model approach works well for simple, CRUD-style applications but starts to become <a id="_idIndexMarker188"/>unwieldy for more complex scenarios. We will discuss some of these scenarios in the next subsections.</p>
			<h3>Volume imbalance between reads and writes</h3>
			<p>In most systems, read operations often outnumber write operations by significant orders of <a id="_idIndexMarker189"/>magnitude. For example, consider the number of times a trader checks stock prices versus the number of times they actually transact (buy or sell stock trades). It is also usually true that write operations are the ones that make businesses money. Having a single model for both reads and writes in a system with a majority of read operations can overwhelm a system to an extent where write performance can become affected.</p>
			<h3>A need for multiple read representations</h3>
			<p>When working with relatively complex systems, it is not uncommon to require more than one representation of the same data. For example, when looking at personal health data, you may want to look at a daily, weekly, or monthly view. While these views can be computed on the fly from the <em class="italic">raw</em> data, each transformation (aggregation, summarization, and so on) adds to the cognitive load on a system. Often, it is not possible to predict ahead of time the nature of these requirements. By extension, it is not feasible to design a single canonical model that can provide answers to all these requirements. Creating domain models specifically designed to meet a focused set of requirements can be much easier.</p>
			<h3>Different security requirements</h3>
			<p>Managing the authorization of and access requirements to data/APIs when working with a single model can start to become cumbersome. For example, higher levels of security may be desirable for debit operations in comparison to balance enquiries. Having distinct models can considerably ease the complexity of designing fine-grained authorization controls.</p>
			<h3>More uniform distribution of complexity</h3>
			<p>Having a model dedicated to serving only command-side use cases means that they can now be focused toward solving a single concern. For query-side use cases, we create models as needed that are distinct from the command-side model. This helps spread complexity more <a id="_idIndexMarker190"/>uniformly over a larger surface area – as opposed to increasing the complexity on a single model that is used to serve all use cases. It is worth noting that the essence of DDD is mainly to work effectively with complex software systems, and CQRS fits well with this line of thinking.</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Note</p>
			<p class="callout">When working with a CQRS-based architecture, choosing the persistence mechanism for the command side is a key decision. When working in conjunction with event-driven architecture, you could choose to persist aggregates as a series of events (ordered in the sequence of their occurrence). This style of persistence is known as event sourcing. We will cover this <a id="_idIndexMarker191"/>in more detail in <a href="B16716_05_Final_NM_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor077"><em class="italic">Chapter 5</em></a>, <em class="italic">Implementing Domain Logic</em>, in the <em class="italic">Event-sourced aggregates</em> section.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-46"><a id="_idTextAnchor045"/>Serverless architecture</h2>
			<p>Serverless architecture is an approach to software design that allows developers to build and run services <a id="_idIndexMarker192"/>without having to manage the underlying <a id="_idIndexMarker193"/>infrastructure. The advent of the AWS Lambda service has popularized this style of architecture, although <a id="_idIndexMarker194"/>several other services (such as S3 and DynamoDB for persistence, SNS for notifications, and SQS for message queuing) existed long before Lambda was launched. While AWS Lambda provides a compute solution in the form of <strong class="bold">Functions as a Service</strong> (<strong class="bold">FaaS</strong>), these other services are just as essential, if not more, in order to benefit from a serverless paradigm.</p>
			<p>In conventional DDD, bounded contexts are formed by grouping related operations around an aggregate, which then informs how the solution is deployed as a unit – usually within the confines of a single process. With a serverless paradigm, each operation (task) is expected to be deployed as an independent unit of its own. This requires that we look at how we model aggregates and bounded contexts differently – now centered around individual tasks or functions, as opposed to a group of related tasks.</p>
			<p>Does that mean that the principles of DDD to arrive at a solution do not apply anymore? While a serverless paradigm introduces an additional dimension of having to treat fine-grained <a id="_idIndexMarker195"/>deployable units as first-class citizens in the <a id="_idIndexMarker196"/>modeling process, the overall process of applying DDD’s strategic and tactical design continues to apply. We will examine this in more detail in <a href="B16716_11_Final_NM_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor164"><em class="italic">Chapter 11</em></a>, <em class="italic">Decomposing into Finer-Grained Components</em>, when we will refactor the solution we build throughout this book to employ a serverless approach.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-47"><a id="_idTextAnchor046"/>The big ball of mud</h2>
			<p>Thus far, we have examined a catalog of named architecture styles along with their pitfalls and how <a id="_idIndexMarker197"/>applying DDD can help alleviate them. At the other extreme, we may <a id="_idIndexMarker198"/>encounter solutions that lack a perceivable architecture, infamously known as the <em class="italic">big ball of mud</em>:</p>
			<p class="author-quote">“A BIG BALL OF MUD is haphazardly structured, sprawling, sloppy, duct-tape and baling wire, spaghetti code jungle. We’ve all seen them. These systems show unmistakable signs of unregulated growth, and repeated, expedient repair. Information is shared promiscuously among distant elements of the system, often to the point where nearly all the important information becomes global or duplicated. The overall structure of the system may never have been well-defined. If it was, it may have eroded beyond recognition. Programmers with a shred of architectural sensibility shun these quagmires. Only those who are unconcerned about architecture, and, perhaps, are comfortable with the inertia of the day-to-day chore of patching the holes in these failing dikes, are content to work on such systems.” </p>
			<p class="author-quote">– Brian Foote and Joseph Yoder</p>
			<p>Although Foote and Yoder advise avoiding this style of architecture at all costs, software systems that resemble the big ball of mud continue to be a day-to-day inevitability for a lot of us. The strategic and tactical design elements of DDD provide a set of techniques to help deal with and recover from these near-hopeless situations in a pragmatic manner, without <a id="_idIndexMarker199"/>potentially having to adopt a big bang approach. Indeed, the <a id="_idIndexMarker200"/>focus of this book is to apply these principles to prevent or at least delay further devolution toward the big ball of mud.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-48"><a id="_idTextAnchor047"/>Which architecture style should you use?</h2>
			<p>As we have seen, there are a variety of architecture styles you can lean on when crafting a software solution. A lot of these architecture styles share quite a few common tenets. It can become <a id="_idIndexMarker201"/>difficult to conform to any single architecture style. DDD, with its emphasis on breaking down complex business problems into subdomains and bounded contexts, enables the use of more than one approach across bounded contexts. We would like to make a special mention of vertical slice architecture because it places an emphasis on dividing functionality into specific business outcomes and, thus, more naturally adheres to DDD’s ideas of subdomains and bounded contexts. In reality, you may find the need to extend and even deviate from pedantic definitions of architecture styles in order to meet real-world needs. But when we do make such compromises, it is important to do so <em class="italic">intentionally</em> and make it unambiguously clear why we are making such a decision (preferably using some lightweight <a id="_idIndexMarker202"/>mechanism, such as <strong class="bold">ADRs</strong> (<a href="https://www.thoughtworks.com/de-de/radar/techniques/lightweight-architecture-decision-records">https://www.thoughtworks.com/de-de/radar/techniques/lightweight-architecture-decision-records</a>). This is important because it may become hard to justify this to others and even ourselves when we look at it in the future.</p>
			<p>In this section, we have examined popular architecture styles and how we can amplify their effectiveness when used in conjunction with DDD. Now, let’s look at how DDD can complement the use of existing programming paradigms.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-49"><a id="_idTextAnchor048"/>Programming paradigms</h1>
			<p>The tactical elements <a id="_idIndexMarker203"/>of DDD introduce a specific vocabulary (aggregates, entities, value objects, repositories, services, factories, domain events, and so on) when arriving at a solution. At the end of the day, we need to translate these concepts into running software. Over the years, we have employed a variety of programming paradigms, including procedural, object-oriented, functional, and aspect-oriented. Is it possible to apply DDD in conjunction with one or more of these paradigms? In this section, we will explore how some common programming paradigms and techniques help us express tactical design elements in code.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-50"><a id="_idTextAnchor049"/>Object-oriented programming</h2>
			<p>On the surface of it, DDD seems to simply replicate a set of OO terms and call them by different names. For <a id="_idIndexMarker204"/>example, the central <a id="_idIndexMarker205"/>concepts of tactical DDD such as aggregates, entities, and value objects could simply be referred to as objects in OO terms. Others such as services may not have a direct OO analog. So, how do you apply DDD in an OO world? Let’s look at a simple example:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer052" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/ch2-2.jpg" alt=""/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p>OO purists will be quick to point out that <strong class="source-inline">PasswordService</strong> is procedural and that a <strong class="source-inline">Password</strong> class <a id="_idIndexMarker206"/>might be needed to encapsulate <a id="_idIndexMarker207"/>related behaviors. Similarly, DDD enthusiasts might point out that this is an anemic domain model implementation. An arguably better OO version might look something like the following:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer053" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/ch2-3.jpg" alt=""/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p>In this case, the <strong class="source-inline">Password</strong> class stops exposing its internals and exposes the idea of a strong or weak password in the form of behavior (the <strong class="source-inline">isStrong</strong> and <strong class="source-inline">isWeak</strong> methods). From <a id="_idIndexMarker208"/>an OO perspective, the <a id="_idIndexMarker209"/>second implementation is arguably superior. If so, shouldn’t we be using the OO version at all times? As it turns out, the answer is nuanced and depends on what consumers desire and the ubiquitous language used in that context. If the concept of <strong class="source-inline">Password</strong> is in common usage within the domain, it perhaps warrants introducing such a concept in the implementation as well. If not, the first solution might suffice, even though it seems to violate OO principles of encapsulation.</p>
			<p>Our default position is to apply good OO practices as a starting point. However, it is more important to mirror the language of the domain as opposed to applying OO in a dogmatic manner. So, we will be willing to compromise on OO purity if it appears unnatural to do so in that context. As mentioned earlier, clearly communicating the rationale for such decisions can go a long way.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-51"><a id="_idTextAnchor050"/>Functional programming</h2>
			<p>Functions are a fundamental building block to code organization that exists in all higher-order programming <a id="_idIndexMarker210"/>languages. Functional programming is a programming <a id="_idIndexMarker211"/>paradigm where programs are constructed by applying and composing functions. This is in contrast to imperative programming, which uses statements to change a program’s state. The most significant differences stem from the fact that functional programming avoids side effects, which are common in imperative programming. Pure functional programming completely prevents side effects and forces immutability. Embracing a functional style when designing a domain model to be more declarative expresses intent a lot more clearly while remaining terse. It also allows us to keep the complexity in check by enabling us to compose more complex concepts by using simpler ones. The functional implementation allows us to use a language closer to the problem domain, while having the added benefit of also being terse. Consider a simple example where we need to find the item with the least inventory across all our warehouses using a functional style, as shown here:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer054" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/ch2-4.jpg" alt=""/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p>The imperative <a id="_idIndexMarker212"/>style shown here does get the job done but is arguably <a id="_idIndexMarker213"/>a lot more verbose and harder to follow, sometimes even for technical team members!</p>
			<p>Here is an imperative example:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer055" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/ch2-5.jpg" alt=""/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p>From a DDD perspective, this yields a few benefits:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Increased collaboration with domain experts</strong> because the declarative style allows placing a bigger focus on the what, rather than the how. This makes it a lot less intimidating to technical and non-technical stakeholders alike to work with on an ongoing basis.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Better testability</strong> because the use of pure functions (those that are side-effect-free) makes it easier to create data-driven tests. This has also afforded us an additional <a id="_idIndexMarker214"/>benefit of less mocking/stubbing. These characteristics <a id="_idIndexMarker215"/>make tests that are a lot easier to maintain and rationalize. This has the benefit of allowing even technical team members to visualize corner cases a lot earlier in the process.</li>
			</ul>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-52"><a id="_idTextAnchor051"/>Which paradigm should you choose?</h2>
			<p>DDD simply states that you should build your software around a domain model that represents the actual problem that the software is trying to solve. When encountering complex real-life problems, we often find it hard to conform to any single paradigm across the board. Looking to use a one-size-fits-all approach may work to our detriment. Our experience indicates <a id="_idIndexMarker216"/>that we will need to make use of a variety of techniques in order to solve the problem at hand elegantly. Java is inherently an OO language, but with the advent of Java 8, it has started to embrace a variety of functional constructs as well. This allows us to make use of a multitude of techniques to create elegant solutions. The most important thing is to agree on a ubiquitous language and allow it to guide the approach taken. It also largely depends on the talent and experience you have at your disposal. Making use of a style that is foreign to the majority of a team will likely prove counterproductive. Although we haven’t covered the procedural paradigm here in this chapter, there may be occasions where it might be the best solution given the current situation. As long as we are intentional about areas where we deviate from the accepted norm for a particular programming paradigm, we should be in a reasonably good place.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-53"><a id="_idTextAnchor052"/>Summary</h1>
			<p>In this chapter, we covered a series of commonly used architecture patterns and how we can practice DDD when working with them. We also looked at common pitfalls and gotchas that we may need to be cognizant of when using these architectures. We also looked at popular programming paradigms and their influence on the tactical elements of DDD.</p>
			<p>Additionally, you should have an appreciation of the various architecture styles that you need to employ when coming up with a solution. In addition, you should have an understanding of how DDD can play a role, no matter which style of architecture you choose to adopt.</p>
			<p>In the next section, we will look to apply all we have learned in this and previous chapters to a real-world business use case. We will apply both the strategic and tactical patterns of DDD to break a complex domain into subdomains and bounded contexts and iteratively build a solution, using technologies that are based on the Java programming language.</p>
