<p class="mce-root">Software engineering and design has existed for many years now. We use software almost everywhere in our lives, and this makes programs distinct in terms of the problems they solve.</p>
<p>Regardless of the number of things that can be done with programming, there are still some specific features that repeat over and over again. Over time, people have come up with some best practices that help to tackle specific patterns that emerge in programs. These are called design patterns.</p>
<p>Design patterns solve not only commonly occurring problems, but also deal with language limitations. No matter what the specific design patterns are and what single issue they solve, all of them in the end aim at producing better software. This includes improved readability, simplicity, easier maintainability, testability, extendibility, and efficiency. Today, design patterns are an important part of every good software engineer's arsenal.</p>
<p>Together with the large number of problems that we tackle with programming, there are also many languages that we can use. Every language is different and has its strengths and weaknesses, so we also need to take this into consideration when doing something. In this book, we will look at design patterns from the point of view of Scala.</p>
<p>Scala has become extremely popular in the last couple of years, and the numbers using it keep growing. Many companies use it in production for various purposes—big data processing, writing APIs, machine learning, and so on. Switching to Scala from popular languages, such as Java, turns out to be quite simple because it is a hybrid of an object-oriented language and a functional programming language. Using Scala to its full potential, however, requires us to be familiar with not only the object-oriented features, but also with the functional ones. The use of Scala could improve performance and the time it takes to implement the features. One of the reasons is the really high expressivity of Scala.</p>
<p>The fact that Scala is close to object-oriented languages means that many of the design patterns for object-oriented programming are still applicable here. The fact that it is also functional means that some other design patterns are also applicable, and some of the object-oriented ones could be modified to better fit the paradigm of Scala. In this book, we will be focusing on all of them—we will go through some specific features of Scala and then look at the popular Gang of Four design patterns viewed from the Scala perspective. We will also become familiar with design patterns that are exclusive to Scala and understand different functional programming concepts, including monoids and monads. Having meaningful examples always makes learning and understanding easier. We will try to provide examples that you can easily map to real problems that you would potentially be solving. We will also introduce some libraries that will be useful for anyone who writes real-world applications.</p>

<p>This book is aimed for people who already have some knowledge of Scala, but want to get a more practical understanding of how to apply it in real-world application development. This book is also useful as a reference to consult while designing applications. Having an understanding of the importance of using best practices and writing nice code is good; however, even if you don't, hopefully, you will be convinced by the time you finish reading this book. Prior knowledge of design patterns is not required, but if you are familiar with some, this book will be useful, as we will take a look at them from the point of view of Scala.</p>

<p>This book assumes that the reader is already familiar with Scala. We have provided examples for each chapter in projects using Maven and SBT. You should have some knowledge of either one of these tools and have it installed on your machine. You are also recommended to have a modern and up-to-date IDE installed on your computer, for example, IntelliJ. You are encouraged to open the actual projects, as the examples in this book focus on the design patterns and, in some cases, imports are omitted in favor of space.</p>
<p>The examples in the book were written and tested on a Unix-based operating system; however, they should also successfully compile and run on Windows.</p>

<p>There are a number of text conventions used throughout this book.</p>
<p><kbd>CodeInText</kbd>: <span>Indicates c</span>ode words in text, database table names, folder names, filenames, file extensions, pathnames, dummy URLs, user input, and Twitter handles. <span>Here is an example:</span> "T<span>he base class is specified using </span><kbd>extends</kbd><span> and then all traits are added using the </span><kbd>with</kbd><span> keyword.</span>"</p>
<p>A block of code is set as follows:</p>
<pre class="mce-root">class MultiplierIdentity {<br/>  def identity: Int = 1<br/>}</pre>
<p>When we wish to draw your attention to a particular part of a code block, the relevant lines or items are set in bold:</p>
<pre>Error:(11, 8) object Clashing inherits conflicting members:<br/>  method hello in trait A of type ()String and<br/>  method hello in trait B of type ()String<br/><strong>(Note: this can be resolved by declaring an override in object Clashing.)</strong><br/><strong>object Clashing extends A with B {</strong><br/><strong>       ^</strong></pre>
<p>Any command-line input or output is written as follows:</p>
<pre class="mce-root"><strong>Result 1: 6</strong><br/><strong>Result 2: 2</strong><br/><strong>Result 3: 6</strong><br/><strong>Result 4: 6</strong><br/><strong>Result 5: 6</strong><br/><strong>Result 6: 3</strong></pre>
