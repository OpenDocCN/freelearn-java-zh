            <p class="mce-root">Java has been a mainstream technology for backend development for many years. Part
               of the reason behind this is its high stability in terms of APIs, hard backward-compatibility
               rules, offering a very stable and reliable backbone for any professional software,
               and its good performance.
            </p>
            
            <p>The Java EE platform gives developers a flexible and powerful API that allows them
               to concentrate on the features more than on the technical challenges already solved
               by the platform. However, it doesn't mean that you should use it blindly and forget
               all about the work the container does for you; it would lead to a poorly behaving
               and unresponsive application.
            </p>
            
            <p>When it comes to performance, Java EE is well-designed to let you get metrics, instrument
               your application, find any potential bottlenecks, enhance your application's performance
               to reach your expected Service Level Agreements (SLAs), and satisfy your customers
               and end users.
            </p>
            
            <p>However, performance is often thought of as something we look at once the application
               is completely developed. This can be true for standalone applications, which are easy to
               optimize as they are self-contained. However, with the advent of microservices and
               distributed applications, you need to think of performance as a continuous process
               in order to avoid having to redevelop your application afterwards.
            </p>
            
            <p>That is all this book is about—giving you the needed tools to be able to work on the
               performance of your Java EE application, ensure you benefit from the simplicity of
               the Java EE API without abusing of them and having bad surprises, ensure you think
               upfront of the whole application flow and not only on a subpart of the full system
               which can lead to local optimizations and global tragedies and finally, ensure you
               can continuously control your performances and thus work smoothly on them during all
               the development phase and succeed to deliver a high quality product.

            <p>This books targets people who have to work with Java and Java EE applications, especially
               people working on performance topics in local or distributed environments and production
               or development environments.
            </p>
            
            <p>This book assumes that you are, at least, familiar with Java 8 development and some
               Java EE concepts. You don't need to be a Java EE guru, but a basic understanding of
               things such as Java proxying and interception will help you get up to speed with the
               concepts covered in the book.

            <p><a href="f8931396-0636-41a9-8bf7-2b67bb424b76.xhtml">Chapter 1</a>, <em>Money – The Quote Manager Application</em><span>, starts by explaining how to set up a basic environment to be able to follow the
                  book's chapters. It also shows you how to develop a common Java EE 8 application,
                  which you can use all along the chapters to easily test every topic.</span></p>
            
            <p><a href="f9d9ccb7-8c28-4f87-9642-8c62a05fa856.xhtml">Chapter 2</a>, <em>Looking Under the Cover – What is This EE Thing?</em><span>, explains why we use a JavaEE 8 container and what it brings to the developers. It
                  goes through some mainstream technologies, and shows the work done under the cover
                  by the server and how it can impact the performance when not used the way it was designed
                  to be.</span></p>
            
            <p><a href="c4d7d24f-3ce9-428c-915c-04296a2c3a85.xhtml">Chapter 3</a>, <em>Monitor Your Application</em><span>, targets the instrumentation of the application in several flavors. The high-level
                  goal is to get the metrics of your application at every level and layer to ensure
                  that you can clearly identify bottlenecks work on the performance of your application.
                  It uses several techniques, more or less simple, and targets the different phases
                  of work you can do on your application.</span></p>
            
            <p><a href="5c06a85d-1010-4342-b5d0-66f8e080d4bd.xhtml">Chapter 4</a>, <em>Application Optimization – Memory Management and Server Configuration</em><span>, targets the configuration you can use to optimize your application without modifying
                  your code at all. It concentrates around JVM memory tuning, which can be very advanced
                  with modern platforms, and Java EE server configuration, which can be worth having
                  a look at.</span></p>
            
            <p><a href="cdbfd25b-1b43-4b9d-b45c-78586b39ebb5.xhtml">Chapter 5</a>, <em>Scale Up – Threading and Implications</em><span>, concentrates on the threading model that Java EE 8 offers. It starts by listing
                  the thread pool you will work with, how you can define new thread pools specific to
                  your application and integrating with the platform, and, finally, it opens the end
                  of the chapter, talking about modern programming models in the Java EE 8 platform,
                  which completely changes the way you use threads to be more reactive.</span></p>
            
            <p><a href="8db12a5f-dba9-449b-af38-4963ac0adec0.xhtml">Chapter 6</a>, <em>Be Lazy; Cache Your Data</em><span>, deals with the caching. It starts by explaining what caching is and how it is supposed
                  to help you improve performance. Then, it explains how Java EE 8 helps you to rely
                  on the cache at HTTP level and how it integrates with JCache specification to speed
                  up your code drastically.</span></p>
            
            <p><a href="6e5d29b4-6df6-4cee-8e72-29ad6a2ddb23.xhtml">Chapter 7</a>, <em>Be Fault-Tolerant</em><span>, helps you design and code distributed applications such as microservices to keep
                  your performance under control and your application stable. The overall goal is to
                  ensure that you don't get affected by services you rely on in a bad manner and that
                  your service stays available irrespective of the state others are in. In other words,
                  it helps you prevent a domino effect on your system if something goes wrong somewhere.</span></p>
            
            <p><a href="65f01d7a-62e1-42c8-90fb-37392b4ed860.xhtml">Chapter 8</a>, <em>Loggers and Performances – A Trade-Off</em><span>, deals with loggers. This is surely the most common API used across all applications,
                  but it can also viciously affect the performance, since a badly used or configured
                  logger can be very significant to your performance figures. This chapter explains
                  what a logging framework is and how to use it. It will help you avoid all these pitfalls.</span></p>
            
            <p><a href="52a8ad84-8021-47ce-ad85-d64c220e58b9.xhtml">Chapter 9</a>, <em>Benchmarking Your Application</em><span>, is about dedicated benchmark projects or phases of your project. It explains which
                  tools to use, what steps to go through so as to ensure your benchmark is useful, and
                  how to get the most out of a benchmark.</span></p>
            
            <p><a href="55aa2cc5-e570-4bfa-9a1f-3d5f25c395ff.xhtml">Chapter 10</a>, <em>Continuous Performance Evaluation</em>, goes through several solutions to make sure that you can evaluate the performance
               of your system in a continuous way. It aims to ensure you can get performance figures
               out of your system at each and every development stage and, used at the extreme, you
               can even get it for each pull request done on your project. This chapter goes through
               some tools and solutions, and explains how to enrich some existing frameworks with
               some glue code to go further and not stay blocked on the topic that is not yet that
               common but very important for applications with a defined SLA.
