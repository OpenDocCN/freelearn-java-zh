    first, Java now has a host of powerful new features that you can adopt to solve
    a variety of modern-day problems; second, the learning curve of modern Java is
    becoming very steep.'

    and meet deadlines, all while becoming a more proficient and self-sufficient Java
    developer. You can count on the 270+ (all brand-new for this edition) problems
    in this book to cover the most common and fundamental areas of interest: strings,
    numbers, arrays, collections, the Foreign Function and Memory API, data structures,
    date and time, pattern matching, sealed/hidden classes, functional programming,
    virtual threads, Structured Concurrency, Garbage Collectors, Dynamic CDS Archives,
    the Socket API, and Simple Web Server.'

- en: Put your skills on steroids with problems that have been carefully crafted to
    highlight and teach the core knowledge needed for daily work. In other words (no
    matter if your task is simple, middling, or complex), having this knowledge in
    your tool belt is a must, not an option.

    concepts, and you’ll have the confidence to develop and choose the right solutions
    to all your Java problems.

    get the most out of it, many of the topics covered in this book are also explored
    in *Java Coding Problems, First Edition.* If you haven’t already read it, and
    you wish to get even more practice in, then consider picking that book up for
    a completely different set of Java problems.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '*Java Coding Problems, Second Edition*, is especially useful for late-beginner-to-intermediate
    Java developers looking to level-up their knowledge by solving real-world problems.
    However, the problems looked at within these pages will be encountered in the
    daily work of any Java developer, from beginner all the way to advanced practitioner.'

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '*Chapter 1*, *Text Blocks, Locales, Numbers, and Math*, includes 37 problems
    covering 4 main topics, text blocks, locales, numbers, and mathematical operations.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '*Chapter 2*, *Objects, Immutability, Switch Expressions, and Pattern Matching*,
    includes 30 problems tackling, among other things, some less-known features of
    `java.util.Objects`, some interesting aspects of immutability, the newest features
    of `switch` expressions, and deep coverage of the pattern matching expressions;
    `instanceof` and `switch`.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '*Chapter 3*, *Working with Date and Time*, includes 20 problems covering different
    date-time topics. These problems are mainly focused on the Calendar API and the
    JDK 8 Date/Time API. About the latter, we will cover some of the less-studied
    APIs like `ChronoUnit`, `ChronoField`, `IsoFields`, and `TemporalAdjusters`.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '*Chapter 4*, *Records and Record Patterns*, includes 19 problems that cover
    in detail the Java records introduced in JDK 16 (JEP 395) and record patterns,
    which were introduced as a preview feature in JDK 19 (JEP 405), as a second preview
    feature in JDK 20 (JEP 432), and as a final feature in JDK 21 (JEP 440).'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '*Chapter 5*, *Arrays, Collections, and Data Structures*, includes 24 problems
    covering three main topics. We start with several problems meant to cover the
    new Vector API dedicated to data parallel processing. We continue with several
    data structures including Rope, Skip List, K-D Tree, Zipper, Binomial Heap, Fibonacci
    Heap, Pairing Heap, Huffman Coding, and so on. Finally, we discuss the three most
    popular join algorithms.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '*Chapter 6*, *Java I/O: Context-Specific Deserialization Filters*, includes
    13 problems related to Java serialization/deserialization processes. We start
    with classical problems like serializing/deserializing objects to `byte[]`, `String`,
    and XML formats. We then continue with JDK 9 deserialization filters meant to
    prevent deserialization vulnerabilities, and we finish with JDK 17 context-specific
    deserialization filters.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '*Chapter 7*, *Foreign (Function) Memory API*, includes 28 problems covering
    the Foreign Function Memory API and Foreign Linker API. We start with the classical
    approaches for calling foreign functions, relying on the JNI API and the open-source
    JNA/JNR libraries. Next, we introduce the new approach delivered under the code
    name Project Panama. We dissect the most relevant APIs such as *Arena*, *MemorySegment*,
    *MemoryLayout*, and so on. Finally, we focus on the Foreign Linker API and the
    Jextract tool for calling foreign functions that have different types of signatures,
    including callback functions.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '*Chapter 8*, *Sealed and Hidden Classes*, includes 13 problems covering Sealed
    and Hidden Classes. The first 11 recipes will cover Sealed Classes, a very cool
    feature brought in by JDK 17 to sustain closed hierarchies. The last two problems
    cover Hidden Classes, a JDK 15 feature that allows frameworks to create and use
    runtime (dynamic) classes hidden to the JVM.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '*Chapter 9*, *Functional Style Programming – Extending APIs*, includes 24 problems
    covering a wide range of functional programming topics. We will start by introducing
    the JDK 16 `mapMulti()` and continue with a handful of problems for working with
    predicates (*Predicate*), functions, and collectors.'

- en: '*Chapter 13*, *Socket API and Simple Web Server*, includes 11 problems covering
    the Socket API and 8 problems covering JDK 18’s Simple Web Server. In the first
    11 problems, we will discuss implementing socket-based applications such as blocking/non-blocking
    server/client applications, datagram-based applications, and multicast applications.
    In the second part of this chapter, we discuss Simple Web Server as a command-line
    tool.'
