- en: The Spring Framework provides great flexibility for Java development, which
    also results in tedious configuration work. Spring Boot addresses the configuration
    difficulties of Spring and makes it easy to create standalone, production-grade
    Spring-based applications.

    *Spring Boot Cookbook 2.0, Second Edition* smartly combines all the skills and
    expertise to efficiently develop, test, deploy, and monitor applications using
    Spring Boot on-premises and in the cloud. We start with an overview of the important
    Spring Boot features you will learn to create a web application for a RESTful
    service. You will also learn how to fine-tune the behavior of a web application
    by learning about custom routes and asset paths and how to modify routing patterns
    along with addressing the requirements of a complex enterprise application and
    understanding the creation of custom Spring Boot starters.

    to create the various kinds of tests introduced in Spring Boot 1.4 and 2.0 and
    gain insights into Spring Boot DevTools. We will explore the basics of Spring
    Boot Cloud modules and various cloud starters to make cloud-native applications
    and take advantage of service discovery and circuit breakers.

    Spring Boot*, provides an overview of the important and useful Spring Boot starters
    that are included in the framework. You will learn how to use [spring.io](https://spring.io/)
    resources, how to get started with a simple project, and how to configure the
    build file to contain their desired starters. The chapter will finish with creating
    a simple command-line application configured to execute some scheduled tasks.'

    provides examples of how to create and add custom servlet filters, interceptors,
    converters, formatters, and PropertyEditors to a Spring Boot web application.
    It will start by creating a new web application and use it as a base to customize
    with the components we discuss earlier in the chapter.'

    Boot Starters*, shows how to create custom Spring Boot starters to provide additional
    behaviors and functionality that might be required for complex enterprise applications.
    You will learn about how the autoconfiguration mechanics works under the hood and
    how to use them to selectively enable/disable default functionality and conditionally
