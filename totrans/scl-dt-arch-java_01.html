<h1 id="_idParaDest-16"><a id="_idTextAnchor015"/>Basics of Modern Data Architecture</h1>
<p>With the advent of the 21st century, due to more and more internet usage and more powerful data insight tools and technologies emerging, there has been a data explosion, and data has become the new gold. This has implied an increased demand for useful and actionable data, as well as the need for quality data engineering solutions. However, architecting and building scalable, reliable, and secure data engineering solutions is often complicated and challenging.</p>
<p>A poorly architected solution often fails to meet the needs of the business. Either the data quality is poor, it fails to meet the SLAs, or it’s not sustainable or scalable as the data grows in production. To help data engineers and architects build better solutions, every year, dozens of open source and preoperatory tools get released. Even a well-designed solution sometimes fails because of a poor choice or implementation of the tools.</p>
<p>This book discusses various architectural patterns, tools, and technologies with step-by-step hands-on explanations to help an architect choose the most suitable solution and technology stack to solve a data engineering problem. Specifically, it focuses on tips and tricks to make architectural decisions easier. It also covers other essential skills that a data architect requires such as data governance, data security, performance engineering, and effective architectural presentation to customers or upper management.</p>
<p>In this chapter, we will explore the landscape of data engineering and the basic features of data in modern business ecosystems. We will cover various categories of modern data engineering problems that a data architect tries to solve. Then, we will learn about the roles and responsibilities of a Java data architect. We will also discuss the challenges that a data architect faces while designing a data engineering solution. Finally, we will provide an overview of the techniques and tools that we’ll discuss in this book and how they will help an aspiring data architect do their job more efficiently and be more productive.</p>
<p>In this chapter, we’re going to cover the following main topics:</p>
<ul>
<li>Exploring the landscape of data engineering</li>
<li>Responsibilities and challenges of a Java data architect</li>
<li>Techniques to mitigate those challenges</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-17"><a id="_idTextAnchor016"/>Exploring the landscape of data engineering </h1>
<p>In this section, you will learn what data engineering is and why it is needed. You will also learn about the <a id="_idIndexMarker000"/>various categories of data engineering problems and some real-world scenarios where they are found. It is important to understand the varied nature of data engineering problems before you learn how to architect solutions for such real-world problems.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-18"><a id="_idTextAnchor017"/>What is data engineering?</h2>
<p>By definition, <strong class="bold">data engineering</strong> is the branch of software engineering that specializes in collecting, analyzing, transforming, <a id="_idIndexMarker001"/>and storing data in a usable and actionable form. </p>
<p>With the growth of social platforms, search engines, and online marketplaces, there has been an exponential increase in the rate of data generation. In 2020 alone, around 2,500 petabytes of data was generated by humans each day. It is estimated that this figure will go up to 468 exabytes per day by 2025. The high volume and availability of data have enabled rapid technological development in AI and data analytics. This has led businesses, corporations, and governments to gather insights like never before to give customers a better experience of their services.</p>
<p>However, raw data usually is seldom used. As a result, there is an increased demand for creating usable data, which is secure and reliable. Data engineering revolves around creating scalable solutions to collect the raw data and then analyze, validate, transform, and store it in a usable and actionable format. Optionally, in certain scenarios and organizations, in modern data engineering, businesses expect usable and actionable data to be published as a service.</p>
<p>Before we dive deeper, let’s explore a few practical use cases of data engineering:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong class="bold">Use case 1</strong>: <strong class="bold">American Express</strong> (<strong class="bold">Amex</strong>) is a leading credit card provider, but it has <a id="_idIndexMarker002"/>a requirement to group customers with similar spending behavior together. This ensures that Amex can generate personalized offers and discounts for targeted customers. To do this, Amex needs to run a clustering algorithm on the data. However, the data is collected from various sources. A few data flows from MobileApp, a few flows from different Salesforce organizations such as sales and marketing, and a few data flows from logs and JSON events will be required. This data is known as raw data, and it can contain junk characters, missing fields, special characters, and sometimes unstructured data such as log files. Here, the data engineering team ingests that data from different sources, cleans it, transforms it, and stores it in a usable structured format. This ensures that the application that performs clustering can run on clean and sorted data.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Use case 2</strong>: A health insurance provider receives data from multiple sources. This data comes from various consumer-facing applications, third-party vendors, Google Analytics, other marketing platforms, and mainframe batch jobs. However, the <a id="_idIndexMarker003"/>company wants a single data repository to be created that can serve different teams as the source of clean and sorted data. Such a requirement can be implemented with the help of data engineering.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now that we understand data engineering, let’s look at a few of its basic concepts. We will start by looking at the dimensions of data.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-19"><a id="_idTextAnchor018"/>Dimensions of data</h2>
<p>Any discussion on data engineering is incomplete without talking about the dimensions of data. The dimensions of data are some basic characteristics by which the nature of data can be <a id="_idIndexMarker004"/>analyzed. The starting point of data engineering is <a id="_idIndexMarker005"/>analyzing and understanding the data.</p>
<p>To successfully analyze and build a data-oriented solution, the four <em class="italic">V</em>s of modern data analysis are very important. These can be seen in the following diagram:</p>
<div>
<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer007">
<img alt="Figure 1.1 – Dimensions of data " height="320" src="image/B17084_01_01.jpg" width="320"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 1.1 – Dimensions of data</p>
<p>Let’s take a look at each of these <em class="italic">V</em>s in detail:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong class="bold">Volume</strong>: This refers to the size of data. The size of the data can be as small as a few bytes <a id="_idIndexMarker006"/>to as big as a few hundred petabytes. Volume analysis usually <a id="_idIndexMarker007"/>involves understanding the size of the whole dataset or the size of a single data record or event. Understanding the size is essential in choosing the type of technologies and infrastructure sizing decisions to process and store the data.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Velocity</strong>: This refers to the speed at which data is getting generated. High-velocity data <a id="_idIndexMarker008"/>requires distributed processing. Analyzing the <a id="_idIndexMarker009"/>speed of data generation is especially critical for scenarios where businesses require usable data to be made available in real-time or near-real-time.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Variety</strong>: This refers to <a id="_idIndexMarker010"/>the various variations in the format in <a id="_idIndexMarker011"/>which the data source can generate the data. Usually, they can be one of the three following types:<ul><li><strong class="bold">Structured</strong>: Structured data is where the number of columns, their data types, and their <a id="_idIndexMarker012"/>positions are fixed. All classical datasets that fit neatly in the relational data model are perfect examples of structured data.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Unstructured</strong>: These datasets don’t conform to a specific structure. Each record in such a <a id="_idIndexMarker013"/>dataset can have any number of columns in any arbitrary format. Examples include audio and video files.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Semi-structured</strong>: Semi-structured data has a structure, but the order of the columns <a id="_idIndexMarker014"/>and the presence of a column in each record is optional. A classical example of such a dataset is any hierarchical data source, such as a <strong class="source-inline">.json</strong> or a <strong class="source-inline">.xml</strong> file.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong class="bold">Veracity</strong>: This refers to the trustworthiness of the data. In simple terms, it is related to the <a id="_idIndexMarker015"/>quality of the data. Analyzing the noise of data is <a id="_idIndexMarker016"/>as important as analyzing any other aspect of the data. This is because this analysis helps create a robust processing rule that ultimately determines how successful a data engineering solution is. Many well-engineered and designed data engineering solutions fail in production due to a lack of understanding about the quality and noise of the source data.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now that we have a fair idea of the characteristics by which the nature of data can be analyzed, let’s understand how they play a vital role in different types of data engineering problems.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-20"><a id="_idTextAnchor019"/>Types of data engineering problems</h2>
<p>Broadly speaking, the <a id="_idIndexMarker017"/>kinds of problems that data engineers solve can be classified into two basic types: </p>
<ul>
<li><strong class="bold">Processing problems</strong></li>
<li><strong class="bold">Publishing problems</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Let’s take a look at these problems in more detail.</p>
<h3>Processing problems</h3>
<p>The problems that <a id="_idIndexMarker018"/>are related to collecting raw <a id="_idIndexMarker019"/>data or events, processing them, and storing them in a usable or actionable data format are broadly categorized as processing <a id="_idIndexMarker020"/>problems. Typical use cases <a id="_idIndexMarker021"/>can be a data ingestion problem such as <strong class="bold">Extract, Transform, Load</strong> (<strong class="bold">ETL</strong>) or a <a id="_idIndexMarker022"/>data analytics problem such as generating a year-on-year report.</p>
<p>Again, processing <a id="_idIndexMarker023"/>problems can be divided into three major categories, as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Batch processing</li>
<li>Real-time processing</li>
<li>Near real-time processing</li>
</ul>
<p>This can be seen in the following diagram: </p>
<div>
<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer008">
<img alt="Figure 1.2 – Categories of processing problems " height="325" src="image/B17084_01_02.jpg" width="1500"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 1.2 – Categories of processing problems</p>
<p>Let’s take a look at each one of these categories in detail. </p>
<h4>Batch processing</h4>
<p>If the SLA of processing is more than 1 hour (for example, if the processing needs to be done once in 2 hours, once <a id="_idIndexMarker024"/>daily, once weekly, or once biweekly), then such a <a id="_idIndexMarker025"/>problem is called a batch processing problem. This is because, when a system processes data at a longer time interval, it usually processes a batch of data records and not a single record/event. Hence, such processing is called <strong class="bold">batch processing</strong>:</p>
<div>
<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer009">
<img alt="Figure 1.3 – Batch processing problem " height="755" src="image/B17084_01_03.jpg" width="691"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 1.3 – Batch processing problem</p>
<p>Usually, a batch processing solution depends on the volume of data. If the data volume is more than <a id="_idIndexMarker026"/>tens of terabytes, usually, it needs to be <a id="_idIndexMarker027"/>processed as big data. Also, since big data processes are schedule-driven, a workflow manager or schedular needs to run its jobs. We will discuss batch processing in more detail later in this book.</p>
<h4>Real-time processing</h4>
<p>A <strong class="bold">real-time processing</strong> problem is a use case where raw data/events are to be processed on the <a id="_idIndexMarker028"/>fly and the response or the processing outcome should <a id="_idIndexMarker029"/>be available within seconds, or at most within 2 to 5 minutes. </p>
<p>As shown in the following diagram, a real-time process receives data in the form of an event stream and immediately processes it. Then, it either sends the processed event to a sink or to another stream of events to be processed further. Since this kind of processing happens on a stream of events, this is known as real-time stream processing:</p>
<div>
<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer010">
<img alt="Figure 1.4 – Real-time stream processing " height="759" src="image/B17084_01_04.jpg" width="1650"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 1.4 – Real-time stream processing</p>
<p>As shown in <em class="italic">Figure 1.4</em>, event E0 gets processed and sent out by the streaming application, while events E1, E2 and E3 are waiting to be processed in the queue. At t1, event E1 also gets processed, showing continuous processing of events by streaming application</p>
<p>An event can generate at any time (24/7), which creates a new kind of problem. If the producer application of an event directly sends the event to a consumer, there is a chance of <a id="_idIndexMarker030"/>event loss, unless the consumer application is running 24/7. Even <a id="_idIndexMarker031"/>bringing down the consumer application for maintenance or upgrades isn’t possible, which means there should be zero downtime for the consumer application. However, any application with zero downtime <a id="_idIndexMarker032"/>is not realistic. Such a model of communication between applications is called <strong class="bold">point-to-point</strong> communication. </p>
<p>Another challenge in point-to-point communication for real-time problems is the speed of processing as this should be always equal to or greater than that of a producer. Otherwise, there <a id="_idIndexMarker033"/>will be a loss of events or a possible memory overrun of the consumer. So, instead <a id="_idIndexMarker034"/>of directly sending events to the consumer application, they are sent asynchronously to an <strong class="bold">Event Bus</strong> or a <strong class="bold">Message Bus</strong>. An Event Bus is a high availability container that can hold events such as a queue or a topic. This pattern <a id="_idIndexMarker035"/>of sending and receiving data asynchronously by introducing a high availability Event Bus in between is called the <strong class="bold">Pub-Sub framework</strong>.</p>
<p>The following <a id="_idIndexMarker036"/>are some important terms related to real-time <a id="_idIndexMarker037"/>processing problems:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong class="bold">Events</strong>: This can be defined as a data packet generated as a result of an action, a trigger, or <a id="_idIndexMarker038"/>an occurrence. They are also popularly known as <strong class="bold">messages</strong> in the Pub-Sub framework.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Producer</strong>: A system <a id="_idIndexMarker039"/>or application that produces and sends events to a <a id="_idIndexMarker040"/>Message Bus is called a <strong class="bold">publisher</strong> or a <strong class="bold">producer</strong>.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Consumer</strong>: A system <a id="_idIndexMarker041"/>or application that consumes events from a Message <a id="_idIndexMarker042"/>Bus to process is called a <strong class="bold">consumer</strong> or a <strong class="bold">subscriber</strong>. </li>
<li><strong class="bold">Queue</strong>: This has a single producer and a single consumer. Once a message/event is consumed by a consumer, that event is removed from the queue. As an analogy, it’s like an SMS or an email sent to you by one of your friends.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Topic</strong>: Unlike a queue, a topic can have multiple consumers and producers. It’s a broadcasting channel. As an analogy, it’s like a TV channel such as HBO, where multiple producers are hosting their show, and if you have subscribed to that channel, you will be able to watch any of those shows.</li>
</ul>
<p>A real-world example of a real-time problem is credit card fraud detection, where you might have experienced an automated confirmation call to verify the authenticity of a transaction from your bank, if any transaction seems suspicious while being executed.</p>
<h4>Near-real-time processing</h4>
<p><strong class="bold">Near-real-time processing</strong>, as its name suggests, is a problem whose response or processing time <a id="_idIndexMarker043"/>doesn’t need to be as fast as real time but should be less <a id="_idIndexMarker044"/>than 1 hour. One of the features of near-real-time processing is that it processes events in micro batches. For example, a near-real-time process may process data in a batch interval of every 5 minutes, a batch size of every 100 records, or a combination of both (whichever condition is satisfied first).</p>
<p>At time tx, all events (E1, E2 and E3) that are generated between t0 and tx are processed together by near real-time processing job. Similarly all events (E4, E5 and E6) between time tx and tn are processed together.</p>
<div>
<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer011">
<img alt="Figure 1.5 – Near-real-time processing " height="1021" src="image/B17084_01_05.jpg" width="1350"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 1.5 – Near-real-time processing</p>
<p>Typical near-real-time <a id="_idIndexMarker045"/>use cases are recommendation problems such as <a id="_idIndexMarker046"/>product recommendations for services such as Amazon or video recommendations for services such as YouTube and Netflix.</p>
<h3>Publishing problems</h3>
<p>Publishing problems deal with publishing the processed data to different businesses and teams so that <a id="_idIndexMarker047"/>data is easily available with proper <a id="_idIndexMarker048"/>security and data governance. Since the main goal of the publishing problem is to expose the data to a downstream system or an external application, having extremely robust data security and governance is essential.</p>
<p>Usually, in modern data architectures, data is published in one of three ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sorted data repositories</li>
<li>Web services</li>
<li>Visualizations</li>
</ul>
<p>Let’s <a id="_idIndexMarker049"/>take a <a id="_idIndexMarker050"/>closer look at each.</p>
<h4>Sorted data repositories</h4>
<p>Sorted data repositories is a common term used for various kinds of repositories that are used to store <a id="_idIndexMarker051"/>processed data. This is usable and <a id="_idIndexMarker052"/>actionable data and can be directly queried by businesses, analytics teams, and other downstream applications for their use <a id="_idIndexMarker053"/>cases. They are broadly divided into three types:</p>
<ul>
<li>Data warehouse</li>
<li>Data lake</li>
<li>Data hub</li>
</ul>
<p>A <strong class="bold">data warehouse</strong> is a central repository of integrated and structured data that’s mainly used for <a id="_idIndexMarker054"/>reporting, data analysis, and <strong class="bold">Business Intelligence</strong> (<strong class="bold">BI</strong>). A <strong class="bold">data lake</strong> consists of <a id="_idIndexMarker055"/>structured and unstructured data, which is mainly used for <a id="_idIndexMarker056"/>data preparation, reporting, advanced analytics, data science, and <strong class="bold">Machine Learning</strong> (<strong class="bold">ML</strong>). A <strong class="bold">data hub</strong> is the central <a id="_idIndexMarker057"/>repository of trusted, governed, and shared data, which <a id="_idIndexMarker058"/>enables seamless data sharing between diverse endpoints and connects business applications to analytic structures such as data warehouses and data lakes.</p>
<h4>Web services</h4>
<p>Another publishing <a id="_idIndexMarker059"/>pattern is where data is published as a service, popularly <a id="_idIndexMarker060"/>known as <strong class="bold">Data as a Service</strong>. This data <a id="_idIndexMarker061"/>publishing pattern has many advantages as it enables security, immutability, and governance by design. Nowadays, as cloud technologies <a id="_idIndexMarker062"/>and GraphQL are becoming popular, Data-as-a-Service is getting a lot <a id="_idIndexMarker063"/>of traction in the industry.</p>
<p>The two popular mechanisms of publishing Data as a Service are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>REST</li>
<li>GraphQL</li>
</ul>
<p>We will discuss these techniques in detail later in this book.</p>
<h4>Visualization</h4>
<p>There’s a popular saying: <em class="italic">A picture is worth a thousand words</em>. Visualization is a technique by <a id="_idIndexMarker064"/>which reports, analytics, and statistics about the data are captured <a id="_idIndexMarker065"/>visually in graphs and charts.</p>
<p>Visualization is helpful for businesses and leadership to understand, analyze, and get an overview of the data flowing in their business. This helps a lot in decision-making and business planning.</p>
<p>A few of the most common and popular visualization tools are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong class="bold">Tableau</strong> is a proprietary data visualization tool. This tool comes with multiple source <a id="_idIndexMarker066"/>connectors to import data into it and create easy fast visualization <a id="_idIndexMarker067"/>using drag-and-drop visualization components such <a id="_idIndexMarker068"/>as graphs and charts. You can find out more about this product at <a href="https://www.tableau.com/">https://www.tableau.com/</a>.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Microsoft Power BI</strong> is a proprietary tool from Microsoft that allows you to collect data <a id="_idIndexMarker069"/>from various data sources to <a id="_idIndexMarker070"/>connect and create powerful dashboards and <a id="_idIndexMarker071"/>visualizations for BI. While both Tableau and Power BI offer data visualization and BI, Tableau is more suited for seasoned data analysts, while Power BI is useful for non-technical or inexperienced users. Also, Tableau works better with huge volumes of data compared to Power BI. You can find out more about this product at <a href="https://powerbi.microsoft.com/">https://powerbi.microsoft.com/</a>.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Elasticsearch-Kibana</strong> is an open source tool whose source code is open source and <a id="_idIndexMarker072"/>has free versions for on-premise installations <a id="_idIndexMarker073"/>and paid subscriptions for cloud installation. This tool helps you ingest data from any data source into Elasticsearch and create visualizations and dashboards using Kibana. Elasticsearch is a powerful text-based <strong class="bold">Lucene</strong> search <a id="_idIndexMarker074"/>engine that not only stores the data but enables various kinds of data aggregation and analysis (including ML analysis). Kibana is a dashboarding tool that works together with Elasticsearch to create very <a id="_idIndexMarker075"/>powerful and useful visualizations. You can find out more about <a id="_idIndexMarker076"/>these products at <a href="https://www.elastic.co/elastic-stack/">https://www.elastic.co/elastic-stack/</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p class="callout-heading">Important note</p>
<p class="callout">A Lucene index is a full-text inverse index. This index is extremely powerful and fast for text-based <a id="_idIndexMarker077"/>searches and is the core indexing technology behind most search engines. A Lucene index takes all the documents, splits them into words or tokens, and then creates an index for each word. </p>
<ul>
<li><strong class="bold">Apache Superset</strong> is a completely open source data visualization tool (developed by Airbnb). It is a <a id="_idIndexMarker078"/>powerful dashboarding <a id="_idIndexMarker079"/>tool and is completely free, but its data source connector support is limited, mostly to SQL databases. A few interesting features are its built-in role-based data access, an API for customization, and <a id="_idIndexMarker080"/>extendibility to support new visualization plugins. You can find out more about this product at <a href="https://superset.apache.org/">https://superset.apache.org/</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>While we have briefly discussed a few of the visualization tools available in the market, there are many <a id="_idIndexMarker081"/>visualizations and competitive alternatives available. Discussing <a id="_idIndexMarker082"/>data visualization in more depth is beyond the scope of this book. </p>
<p>So far, we have provided an overview of data engineering and the various types of data engineering problems. In the next section, we will explore what role a Java data architect plays in the data engineering landscape.</p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-21"><a id="_idTextAnchor020"/>Responsibilities and challenges of a Java data architect</h1>
<p>Data architects are senior technical leaders who map business requirements to technical requirements, envision <a id="_idIndexMarker083"/>technical solutions to solve business problems, and establish data standards and principles. Data architects play a unique role, where they understand both the business and technology. They are like the <em class="italic">Janus</em> of business and technology, where on one hand they can look, understand, and communicate with the business, and on the other, they do the same with technology. Data architects create processes that are used to plan, specify, enable, create, acquire, maintain, use, archive, retrieve, control, and purge data. According to DAMMA’s data management body of knowledge, <em class="italic">a data architect provides a standard common business vocabulary, expresses strategic requirements, outlines high-level integrated designs to meet those requirements, and aligns with the enterprise strategy and related business architecture.</em></p>
<p>The following diagram shows the cross-cutting concerns that a data architect handles:</p>
<div>
<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer012">

</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 1.6 – Cross-cutting concerns of a data architect</p>
<p>The typical responsibilities <a id="_idIndexMarker084"/>of a Java data architect are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Interpreting business requirements into technical specifications, which includes data storage and integration patterns, databases, platforms, streams, transformations, and the technology stack</li>
<li>Establishing the architectural framework, standards, and principles</li>
<li>Developing and designing reference architectures that are used as patterns that can be followed by others to create and improve data systems</li>
<li>Defining data flows and their governance principles</li>
<li>Recommending the most suitable solutions, along with their technology stacks, while considering scalability, performance, resource availability, and cost</li>
<li>Coordinating and collaborating with multiple departments, stakeholders, partners, and external vendors</li>
</ul>
<p>In the real world, a data architect is supposed to play a combination of three disparate roles, as shown in the following diagram: </p>
<div>
<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer013">
<img alt="Figure 1.7 – Multifaced role of a data architect " height="900" src="image/B17084_01_07.jpg" width="810"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 1.7 – Multifaced role of a data architect</p>
<p>Let’s look at these three architectural roles in more detail:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong class="bold">Data architectural gatekeeper</strong>: An architectural gatekeeper is a person or a role that <a id="_idIndexMarker085"/>ensures the data model is following the necessary standards and that the architecture is following the proper architectural principles. They look for any gaps in terms of the solution or business expectations. Here, a data architect takes a negative role in finding <a id="_idIndexMarker086"/>faults or gaps in the product or solution design and delivery (including a lack of or any gap in best practices in the data model, architecture, implementation techniques, testing procedures, <strong class="bold">continuous integration/continuous delivery</strong> (<strong class="bold">CI/CD</strong>) efforts, or business expectations).</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Data advisor</strong>: A data advisor is a data architect that focuses more on finding solutions rather <a id="_idIndexMarker087"/>than finding a problem. A data advisor highlights issues, but more importantly, they show an opportunity or propose a solution for them. A data advisor should understand the technical <a id="_idIndexMarker088"/>as well as the business aspect of a problem and solution and should be able to advise to improve the solution.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Business executive</strong>: Apart from the technical roles that a data architect plays, the data <a id="_idIndexMarker089"/>architect needs to play an executive role as well. As stated earlier, the data architect is like the Janus of business and technology, so they are expected to be a great communicator and sales executive who can sell their idea or solution (that is technical) to nontechnical folks. Often, a data architect needs to present elevator speeches to higher leadership to show opportunities and convince them of a solution for business problems. To be successful in this role, a data architect must think like a business executive – <em class="italic">What is the ROI? Or what is there for me in it? How much can we save in terms of time and money with this solution or opportunity?</em> Also, a data architect should be concise and articulate in presenting their idea so that it creates immediate interest among the listeners (mostly business executives, clients, or investors).</li>
</ul>
<p>Let’s understand the difference between a data architect and data engineer.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-22"><a id="_idTextAnchor021"/>Data architect versus data engineer</h2>
<p>The data architect <a id="_idIndexMarker090"/>and data engineer are related roles. A data <a id="_idIndexMarker091"/>architect visualizes, conceptualizes, and creates the blueprint of the data engineering solution and framework, while the data engineer takes the blueprint and implements the solution.</p>
<p>Data architects are responsible for putting data chaos in order, generated by enormous piles of business <a id="_idIndexMarker092"/>data. Each data analytics or data science team requires a data architect <a id="_idIndexMarker093"/>who can visualize and design the data framework to create clean, analyzed, managed, formatted, and secure data. This framework can be utilized further by data engineers, data analysts, and data scientists for their work.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-23"><a id="_idTextAnchor022"/>Challenges of a data architect</h2>
<p>Data architects face <a id="_idIndexMarker094"/>a lot of challenges in their day-to-day work. We will be focusing on the main challenges that a data architect faces on a day-to-day basis:</p>
<ul>
<li> Choosing the right architectural pattern</li>
<li>Choosing the best-fit technology stack</li>
<li>Lack of actionable data governance</li>
<li>Recommending and communicating effectively to leadership </li>
</ul>
<p>Let’s take a closer look.</p>
<h3>Choosing the right architectural pattern</h3>
<p>A single data engineering problem can be solved in many ways. However, with the ever-evolving expectations <a id="_idIndexMarker095"/>of customers and the evolution of new technologies, choosing the correct architectural pattern has become more challenging. What is more interesting is that with the changing technological landscape, the need for agility and extensibility in architecture has increased many folds to avoid unnecessary costs and sustainability of architecture over time.</p>
<h3>Choosing the best-fit technology stack</h3>
<p>One of the complex problems that a data architect needs to figure out is the technology stack. Even when <a id="_idIndexMarker096"/>you have created a very well-architected solution, whether your solution will fly or flop will depend on the technology stack you are choosing and how you are planning to use it. As more and more tools, technologies, databases, and frameworks are developed, a big challenge remains for data architects to choose an optimum tech stack that can help create a scalable, reliable, and robust solution. Often, a data architect needs to take into account other non-technical factors as well, such as the future growth prediction of the tool, the market availability of skilled resources for those tools, vendor lock-in, cost, and community support options.</p>
<h3>Lack of actionable data governance</h3>
<p>Data governance is a <a id="_idIndexMarker097"/>buzzword in data businesses, but what does it mean? Governance is a broad area that includes both workflows and toolsets to govern data. If either the tools or the <a id="_idIndexMarker098"/>workflow process has limitations or is not present, then data governance is incomplete. When we talk about actionable governance, we mean the following elements:</p>
<ul>
<li>Integrating data <a id="_idIndexMarker099"/>governance with all data engineering systems to maintain standard metadata, including traceability of events and logs for a standard timeline</li>
<li>Integrating data governance concerning all the security policies and standards</li>
<li>Role-based and user-based access management policies on all data elements and systems</li>
<li>Adherence to defined metrics that are tracked continually</li>
<li>Integrating data governance and the data architecture</li>
</ul>
<p>Data governance should always be aligned with strategic and organizational goals.</p>
<h3>Recommending and communicating effectively to leadership </h3>
<p>Creating an optimal architecture and the correct set of tools is a challenging task, but it never is enough, unless <a id="_idIndexMarker100"/>and until they are not put into practice. One of the hats that a data architect often <a id="_idIndexMarker101"/>needs to wear is that of a sales executive who needs to sell their solution to the business executive or upper leadership. These are not usually technical people and they don’t have a lot of time. Data architects, most of whom have strong technical backgrounds, face the daunting task of communicating and selling their idea to these people. To convince them about the opportunity and the idea, a data architect needs to back them up with proper decision metrics and information that can align that opportunity to the broader business goals of the organization. </p>
<p>So far, we have seen the role of a data architect and the common problems that they face. In the next section, we will provide an overview of how a data architect mitigates those challenges on a day-to-day basis.</p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-24"><a id="_idTextAnchor023"/>Techniques to mitigate those challenges</h1>
<p>In this section, we <a id="_idIndexMarker102"/>will discuss how a data architect can mitigate the aforementioned challenges. To understand the mitigation plan, it is important to understand what the life cycle of a data architecture looks like and <a id="_idIndexMarker103"/>how a data architect contributes to it. The following diagram shows the life cycle of a data architecture:</p>

</div>

<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 1.8 – Life cycle of a data architecture</p>
<p>The data architecture starts with defining the problem that the business is facing. Here, this is mainly identified or reported by business teams or customers. Then, the data architects work closely with the business to define the business requirements. However, in a data engineering landscape, that is not enough. In a lot of cases, there are hidden requirements or <a id="_idIndexMarker104"/>anomalies. To mitigate such problems, business analysts team up with data architects to analyze data and the current state of the system, including any existing solution, the current cost, or loss of revenue due to the problem and infrastructure where data resides. This helps refine the business requirements. Once the business requirements are more or less frozen, the data architects map the business requirements to the technical requirements.</p>
<p>Then, the data architect defines the standards and principles of the architecture and determines the priorities of the architecture based on the business need and budget. After that, the data architect creates the most suitable architectures, along with their proposed technology <a id="_idIndexMarker105"/>stack. In this phase, the data architects closely work with the data engineers to implement <strong class="bold">proof of concept</strong> (<strong class="bold">POCs</strong>) and evaluate the proposed solution in terms of feasibility, scalability, and performance. </p>
<p>Finally, the architects recommend solutions based on the evaluation results and architectural priorities defined earlier. The data architects present the proposed solutions to the <a id="_idIndexMarker106"/>business. Based on priorities such as cost, timeline, operational cost, and resource availability, feedback is received from the business and clients. It takes a few iterations to solidify and get an agreement on the architecture. </p>
<p>Once an agreement has been reached, the solution is implemented. Based on the implementation challenges and particular use cases, the architecture may or may not be revised or tweaked a little. Once an architecture is implemented and goes to production, it enters the maintenance and operations phase. During maintenance and operations, sometimes, feedback is provided, which might result in a few architectural improvements and changes, but they are often seldom if the solution is well-architected in the first place.</p>
<p>In the preceding diagram, the blue boxes indicate major involvement from a customer, a green box indicates major involvement from a data architect, a yellow box means a data architect equally shares involvement with another stakeholder, and a gray box means the data architect has the least involvement in that scenario.</p>
<p>Now that we have understood the life cycle of the data architecture and a data architect’s role in various phases, we will focus on how to mitigate those challenges that are faced by a <a id="_idIndexMarker107"/>data architect.
