    methods that are invoked when our web service receives one of the above HTTP request
    methods. Once we have developed and deployed our RESTful web service, we need
    to develop a client that will send requests to our service. JAX-RS 2.0 introduces
    a standard client-side API that we can use to develop RESTful web service clients.

    we need to specify the MIME type of the data to be consumed; this is done via
    the `@Consumes` annotation. All methods in our service except `getCustomer()`

    returned by `client.target()`. This method appends the specified path to our `WebTarget`
    instance; the value of this method must match the value of the `@Path` annotation
    in our RESTful web service.

    `resolveTemplate()`; the first parameter for this method is the name of the parameter
    (without the curly braces) and the second parameter is the value we wish to pass
    as a parameter to our RESTful web service.

- en: In this chapter, we discussed how to develop RESTful web services using JAX-RS,
    a new addition to the Java EE specification.

  zh: 在本章中，我们讨论了如何使用 JAX-RS 开发 RESTful 网络服务，这是 Java EE 规范的新增内容。
- en: We covered how to develop a RESTful web service by adding a few simple annotations
    to our code. We also explained how to automatically convert data between Java
    and XML by taking advantage of the Java API for XML Binding (JAXB).
