Several existing Java EE APIs have gone through major improvements in this version of the specification; additionally, some brand new APIs have been added to Java EE. This book includes coverage of the latest versions of the most popular Java EE specifications, including JavaServer Faces (JSF), Java Persistence API (JPA), Enterprise JavaBeans (EJB), Contexts and Dependency Injection (CDI), the new Java API for JSON Processing (JSON-P), WebSocket, the completely revamped Java Messaging Service (JMS) API 2.0, the Java API for XML Web Services (JAX-WS) and the Java API for RESTful Web Services (JAX-RS), as well as securing Java EE applications.</p><p>The GlassFish application server is the reference implementation for Java EE; it is the first Java EE application server in the market to support Java EE 7. This book covers GlassFish 4.0, the latest version of this powerful open source application server.</p><div class="section" title="What this book covers"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl1sec02"/>What this book covers</h1></div></div></div><p>
