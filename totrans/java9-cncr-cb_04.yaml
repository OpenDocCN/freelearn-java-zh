    first you create some `Runnable` objects and then the corresponding `Thread` objects

    tasks, this approach will present the following disadvantages:'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Since Java 5, the Java concurrency API provides a mechanism that aims to resolve
    these problems. This mechanism is called the **Executor framework** and is around
    the `Executor` interface, its subinterface `ExecutorService`, and the `ThreadPoolExecutor`
    class that implements both these interfaces.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'This mechanism separates task creation and execution. With an executor, you
    only have to implement either `Runnable` or `Callable` objects and send them to
    the executor. It is responsible for their execution, running them with the necessary
    threads. But it goes beyond this; it improves performance using a pool of threads.
    When you send a task to the executor, it tries to use a pooled thread for the
    execution of the task. It does so to avoid the continuous spawning of threads.
    Another important advantage of the `Executor` framework is the `Callable` interface.
    It''s similar to the `Runnable` interface but offers two improvements, which are
    as follows:'

    the `Future` interface. You can use this object to control the status and the

- en: Creating a thread executor and controlling its rejected tasks
  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The first step toward working with the `Executor` framework is to create an
    object of the `ThreadPoolExecutor` class. You can use the four constructors provided
    by this class or use a factory class named `Executors`, which creates `ThreadPoolExecutor`.
    Once you have an executor, you can send `Runnable` or `Callable` objects to be
    executed.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When you want to finish the execution of an executor, use the `shutdown()` method.
    The executor waits for the completion of tasks that are either running or waiting
    for their execution. Then, it finishes the execution.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you send a task to an executor between the `shutdown()` method and the end
    of its execution, the task will be rejected. This is because the executor no longer
    accepts new tasks. The `ThreadPoolExecutor` class provides a mechanism, which
    is called when a task is rejected.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    new `ThreadPoolExecutor` object, how to send tasks to the `Executor`, and how
    to control the rejected tasks of the `Executor` class.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The key of this example is the `Server` class. This class creates and uses `ThreadPoolExecutor`
    to execute tasks.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The first important point is the creation of `ThreadPoolExecutor` in the constructor
    of the `Server` class. The `ThreadPoolExecutor` class has four different constructors,
    but due to their complexity, the Java concurrency API provides the `Executors`
    class to construct executors and other related objects. Although you can create
    `ThreadPoolExecutor` directly using one of its constructors, it's recommended
    that you use the `Executors` class.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In this case, you created a cached thread pool using the `newFixedThreadPool()`
    method of the `Executors` class in order to create the executor. This method creates
    an executor with the maximum number of threads. If the number of tasks you send
    is more than the number of threads, the remaining tasks will be blocked until
    there is a free thread available to process them. This method receives the maximum
    number of threads you want to have in your executor as parameters. In our case,
    we used the `availableProcessors()` method of the `Runtime` class that returns
    the number of processors available to JVM. Normally, this number matches the number
    of cores of the computer.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Reutilization of threads has the advantage that it reduces the time taken for
    thread creation. The cached thread pool, however, has the disadvantage of having
    constant lying threads for new tasks. Therefore, if you send too many tasks to
    this executor, you could overload the system.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Once you have created the executor, you can send tasks of the `Runnable` or
    `Callable` type for execution using the `execute()` method. In this case, you
    sent objects of the `Task` class that implements the `Runnable` interface.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One critical aspect of the `ThreadPoolExecutor` class, and of executors in general,
    is that you have to end them explicitly. If you don't do this, the executor will
    continue its execution and the program won't end. If the executor doesn't have
    tasks to execute, it continues waiting for new tasks and doesn't end its execution.
    A Java application won't end until all its non-daemon threads finish their execution.
    So, if you don't terminate the executor, your application will never end.

- en: 'To indicate to the executor that you want to finish it, use the `shutdown()`
    method of the `ThreadPoolExecutor` class. When the executor finishes the execution

    be rejected and the executor will throw a `RejectedExecutionException` exception,
    unless you have implemented a manager for rejected tasks, as in our case. To manage
    the rejected tasks of an executor, you need to create a class that implements
    the `RejectedExecutionHandler` interface. This interface has a method called `rejectedExecution()`

    in the pool and the number of threads that are being executed are represented

    is done, we shut down the executor and the next task is rejected. `RejectedTaskController`

    be executed despite the finalization of the executor. You can change this behavior
    using the `setExecuteExistingDelayedTasksAfterShutdownPolicy()` method of the
    `ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor` class. If you call the `setExecuteExistingDelayedTasksAfeterShutdownsPolicy()` passing
    the `false` value as parameter, pending tasks won't be executed after you call
    the `shutdown()` method.

    When you send a task to the executor, it executes the task as soon as possible
    according to its configuration. When it ends, the task is deleted from the executor,
    and if you want to execute it again, you have to send it to the executor again.

- en: When you want to execute a periodic task using the Executor framework, you need
    a `ScheduledExecutorService` object. To create it (as with every executor), Java
    recommends the use of the `Executors` class. This class works as a factory of
    executor objects. In this case, you used the `newScheduledThreadPool()` method
    to create a `ScheduledExecutorService` object. This method receives the number
    of threads of the pool as a parameter. Since you had only one task in this example,
    you passed `1` as a parameter.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'Once you had the executor needed to execute a periodic task, you sent the task
    to the executor. You used the `scheduledAtFixedRate()` method. This method accepts
    four parameters: the task you want to execute periodically, the delay of time
    until the first execution of the task, the period between two executions, and
    the time unit of the second and third parameters. It''s a constant of the `TimeUnit`
    class. The `TimeUnit` class is an enumeration with the following constants: `DAYS`,
    `HOURS`, `MICROSECONDS`, `MILLISECONDS`, `MINUTES`, `NANOSECONDS`, and `SECONDS`.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: An important point to consider is that the period between two executions is
    the period of time between the start of those two executions. If you have a periodic
    task that takes 5 seconds to execute and you put in a period of 3 seconds, you
    will have two instances of the task executing at a time.

    extends the `Future` interface, with methods to work with scheduled tasks. `ScheduledFuture`
    is a parameterized interface. In this example, as your task was a `Runnable` object
    that was not parameterized, you had to parameterize them with the `?` symbol as
    a parameter.

    `Runnable` or `Callable` tasks and send them to the executor. It's the executor
    that's responsible for creating threads, managing them in a thread pool, and finishing
    them if they are not needed. Sometimes, you may want to cancel a task that you
    send to the executor. In that case, you can use the `cancel()` method of `Future`,

- en: The Java API provides the `FutureTask` class as a cancelable asynchronous computation.
    It implements the `Runnable` and `Future` interfaces and provides the basic implementation
    of the `Future` interface. We can create a `FutureTask` class using a `Callable`
    or `Runnable` object `(Runnable` objects doesn't return a result, so we have to
    pass as parameter too in this case the result that the `Future` object will return).
    It provides methods to cancel the execution and obtain the result of the computation.
    It also provides a method called `done()` that allows you to execute some code
    after the finalization of a task executed in an executor. It can be used to make
    some postprocess operations, such as generating a report, sending results by e-mail,
    or releasing some resources. This method is called internally by the `FutureTask`
    class when the execution of the task that this `FutureTask` object is controlling
    finishes. The method is called after the result of the task is set and its status
    is changed to `isDone`, regardless of whether the task has been canceled or finished
    normally.

    `Runnable` or `Callable` tasks to the executor and get `Future` objects to control

    in one object and process the results in another one. For such situations, the

- en: The `CompletionService` class has a method to send tasks to an executor and
    a method to get the `Future` object for the next task that has finished its execution.
    Internally, it uses an `Executor` object to execute the tasks. This behavior has
    the advantage of sharing a `CompletionService` object and sending tasks to the
    executor so others can process the results. The limitation is that the second
    object can only get the `Future` objects for those tasks that have finished their
    execution, so these Future objects can only be used to get the results of the
    tasks.

- en: How it works...
  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In the main class of the example, you created `ThreadPoolExecutor` using the
    `newCachedThreadPool()` method of the `Executors` class. Then, you used that `Executor`
    object to initialize a `CompletionService` object because the completion service
    uses an executor to execute its tasks. To execute a task using the completion
    service, use the `submit()` method, as in the `ReportRequest` class.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When one of these tasks is executed when the completion service finishes its
    execution, the service stores the `Future` object used to control its execution
    in a queue. The `poll()` method accesses this queue to check whether there is
    any task that has finished its execution; if yes, it returns the first element
    of the queue, which is a `Future` object of a task that has finished its execution.
    When the `poll()` method returns a `Future` object, it deletes it from the queue.
    In this case, you passed two attributes to the method to indicate the time you
    want to wait for the finalization of a task, in case the queue with the results
    of the finished tasks is empty.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Once the `CompletionService` object is created, you create two `ReportRequest`
    objects that execute a `ReportGenerator` task, execute a `ReportGenerator` task
    using the `CompletionService` object create before and passed as parameter to
    the constructor of the `ReportRequest` objects
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There's more...
  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The `CompletionService` class can execute `Callable` or `Runnable` tasks. In
    this example, you used `Callable`, but you could have also sent `Runnable` objects.
    Since `Runnable` objects don't produce a result, the philosophy of the `CompletionService`
    class doesn't apply in such cases.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'This class also provides two other methods to obtain the `Future` objects of
    the finished tasks. These methods are as follows:'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '`poll()`: The version of the `poll()` method without arguments checks whether
    there are any `Future` objects in the queue. If the queue is empty, it returns
    null immediately. Otherwise, it returns its first element and removes it from
    the queue.'
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '`take()`: This method, without arguments, checks whether there are any `Future`
    objects in the queue. If it is empty, it blocks the thread until the queue has
    an element. If the queue has elements, it returns and deletes its first element
    from the queue.'
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In our case, we used the `poll()` method with a timeout to control when we would
    like to end the execution of the `ReportProcessor` task.
