<p>The recommended way to install JDK, Scala, and SBT is by using<span> the SDK manager available at </span><span><a href="https://sdkman.io">https://sdkman.io</a>. Please refer to the instructions on the web page to complete the installation. </span></p>
<p>Further, we'll describe the process of manual installation for Java and SBT. For your convenience, we've packaged the commands represented in further screenshots as scripts for OS X and Linux and made them available in the <kbd>Appendix</kbd> folder in the GitHub repository at: <a href="https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Learn-Scala-Programming/tree/master/Appendix">https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Learn-Scala-Programming/tree/master/Appendix</a><a href="https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Learn-Scala---Fundamentals-of-Scala-2.13/tree/master/appendix_a">.</a></p>

<p>At the moment, as of writing this, the last available JDK version available at <a href="http://jdk.java.net">http://jdk.java.net</a> was 11. Scala 2.13 requires Java 1.8+.</p>
<p>It is possible to install Java on Linux or macOS X platforms by using one of the existing tools, such as <kbd>apt</kbd> or <kbd>yum</kbd>, using the package manager for Linux or <kbd>brew</kbd> for an OS X environment. Please use the help pages and guides available for the respective tools if you intend to install the JDK this way. </p>
<p><span>The manual installation of Java consists of three steps:</span></p>
<ol>
<li>Downloading the package from the internet. The choice of distribution files for different platforms is offered at <a href="http://jdk.java.net/11/">http://jdk.java.net/11/</a>.<a href="http://jdk.java.net/11/"/></li>
<li>Extracting the installation file.</li>
<li>Updating the environment.</li>
</ol>
<p>With Linux or OS X, you can use the following sequence of shell commands to perform all these steps, as shown in the next two screenshots:</p>

<div class="packt_figref CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign">Installing JDK 11 in OS X</div>
<p>The installation flow in Linux is so similar that we have even refrained from putting arrows into the screenshot:</p>

<div class="packt_figref CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign">The same steps in Linux</div>
<p>On Windows, you'll need to use the web browser to download the installation package, the file navigator to unpack it, and<span> system settings </span>to update the path variable. Please be aware that Java 11 is only available as a 64-bit version, so if you have a 32-bit system you have to install one of the previous versions of the JVM.</p>
<p>Please follow the steps outlined in the following screenshots to perform the setup:</p>
<ol>
<li>First, download the installation file from the internet:</li>

<p>The next step after installing Java is the installation of SBT. You are not required to have Scala installed separately to be able to work with the sample code for this book.</p>

<p>For the SBT, the simple build tool, there are installation options: using tools such as <kbd>apt-get</kbd>, <kbd>brew</kbd>, or <kbd>macports</kbd>, or doing it manually. First, we'll cover the manual setup.</p>
<p>For Linux and macOS, the procedure is the same as with JDK:</p>
<ol>
<li>Obtain the installation package.</li>
<li>Unzip the downloaded file.</li>
<li>Update the environment.</li>
</ol>
<p>The latest version of the SBT can be found on the respective website at <a href="https://www.scala-sbt.org/download.html">https://www.scala-sbt.org/download.html</a>.</p>
<p>On Linux or macOS, you can use the command line in a way shown in the next screenshot to perform these three installation steps:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="Images/e5064e69-66a9-424d-ad6f-0a0dd058b6ba.png" width="2453" height="839"/></p>
<p><span>We have included an installation script in the <kbd>Appendix</kbd></span> <span>folder in the GitHub repository to save you some typing.</span></p>
<p>On Windows, the installation is done a bit differently. The website will offer you an MSI package for download, which can be installed after downloading by double-clicking on it, as shown in the next screenshot:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="Images/aab88dec-f2b8-467a-b4cf-8ef6bd8fa2bc.png" style="width:43.75em;height:20.67em;" width="1234" height="583"/></p>
<div class="packt_figref CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign">Downloading an SBT installation package</div>
<p>After the SBT installer is downloaded, it can be executed:</p>

<div class="packt_figref CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign">Steps to start the SBT installation</div>
<p>After the installation has started, just follow the steps in the wizard to finish the setup.</p>

<p>In this section, we will give you a short introduction to how to download and work with the source code using the SBT console and Scala REPL.</p>

<p>The recommended way to install the accompanying code is by cloning it using Git utilities. As we're updating and improving the code if needed, this will allow us to get future changes easily. Please refer to the installation instructions for the Git tools for your operating system.</p>
<p>In this case, there are no Git tools available; the source code can be downloaded using a web browser or other download tool. There is a <span class="packt_screen">Download ZIP</span> button in the GitHub repository which will generate the proper URL to be used for the download, as shown next:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="Images/e87e2fb8-4e2d-4446-a752-ca983d6a7bc8.png" width="2269" height="1258"/></p>
<p>The following screenshot demonstrates both approaches for cloning and downloading the source code:</p>

<p>Cloning or downloading the source code concludes the first-time setup procedure.</p>

<p>The source code is organized in such a way that each chapter has its own folder, named by convention as <a href="7bfb7bf2-2fc8-41a3-a34f-73d262e5c674.xhtml">Chapter 1</a>, <em>An Introduction to Scala 2.13</em>, to <a href="ae25231b-af47-4138-82a9-e14a94ace448.xhtml">Chapter 15</a>, <em>Project 2 - Building Microservices with Lagom</em>. You can experiment with examples by navigating to the appropriate folder and starting SBT. It is recommended to occasionally issue the <kbd>git pull</kbd> command for the cloned repository to get recent updates and bug fixes, shown as follows:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="Images/ff2ea739-834a-4553-80f9-b63a09283cbb.png" width="1798" height="330"/></p>
<p>Each chapter has its own configuration files, <kbd>project/build.properties</kbd> and <kbd>build.sbt</kbd>. The former configure the version of the SBT to be used, the latter the required version of Scala and other dependencies. The SBT will download and cache all configured versions as required. This is why we don't need a separate installation of Scala.</p>

<p>After starting SBT, one lands in the interactive mode or SBT <strong>shell</strong>. The shell allows for the issuing of different commands to drive SBT to test, execute, or do something else with the source code. The most important for our purposes are the following commands:</p>
<ul>
<li><kbd>exit</kbd>: Closes the SBT and exits into the Terminal shell</li>
<li><kbd>test</kbd>: Runs all test suites in the current project (if there are any in the <kbd>src/test/scala</kbd> folder)</li>
</ul>
<p>The next screenshot shows how SBT compiles and runs tests for <a href="87c2e446-3730-49ae-b86b-fc8269678399.xhtml">Chapter 11</a>, <em>An Introduction to the Akka and Actor Models</em>:</p>

<ul>
<li><kbd>run</kbd>: Runs the main class if there is a single main class in the project. This command will throw an exception in the case that it fails to detect the <kbd>main</kbd> class. If there are multiple main classes, the SBT will ask you to pick one of them to run. This behavior is represented by the following screenshot:</li>

<p>REPL is a tool for evaluating expressions in Scala. It can be started from the command line by entering <kbd>scala</kbd> or directly from the SBT session. The nice thing about starting it from the SBT shell is that all of the dependencies configured for the project will be available, as shown in the next screenshot:</p>

<p>Please refer to the Scala documentation at <a href="https://docs.scala-lang.org/overviews/repl/overview.html">https://docs.scala-lang.org/overviews/repl/overview.html</a> to learn how to use REPL efficiently.</p>
