This Cookbook has been created to provide you with best practices and lessons learned from working with Apache Karaf in the trenches.</p><p>The recipes in this book are not to be read in a serial manner. Readers are expected to pick and choose recipes as per their needs. We've taken the greatest care to make sure it's possible to refer to foundational knowledge wherever applicable. However, we do expect our audience to have some background in OSGi, Karaf, and the packages each recipe focuses on. Readers requiring more background information on Karaf and OSGi might seek out the following books:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="emphasis"><em>Learning Apache Karaf</em></span>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Johan Edstrom, Jamie Goodyear, and Heath Kesler</em></span>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Packt Publishing</em></span></li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="emphasis"><em>Instant OSGi Starter</em></span>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Johan Edstrom and Jamie Goodyear</em></span>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Packt Publishing</em></span></li></ul></div><div class="section" title="What this book covers"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl1sec02"/>What this book covers</h1></div></div></div><p>
