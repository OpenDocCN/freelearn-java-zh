- en: Maven is the number one build tool used by developers, and it has been there
    for more than a decade. Maven stands out among other build tools due to its extremely
    extensible architecture, which is built on top of the concept convention over
    configuration. This, in fact, has made Maven the de-facto tool to manage and build
    Java projects. It's being used widely by many open source Java projects under
    the Apache Software Foundation, SourceForge, Google Code, and many more.
