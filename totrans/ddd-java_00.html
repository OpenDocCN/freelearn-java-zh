			<p><strong class="bold">Domain-driven design</strong> (<strong class="bold">DDD</strong>) makes available a set of principles, patterns, and techniques that subject-matter experts, architects, developers, and other team members can adopt to work together and decompose complex systems into well-factored, collaborative, and loosely coupled subsystems. When Eric Evans introduced these concepts in the early 2000s, in a lot of ways, these principles were way ahead of their time. We were firmly in the age of the monolith, <strong class="bold">service-oriented architectures</strong> (<strong class="bold">SOAs</strong>) as a concept were just starting to take root, and the cloud, microservices, continuous delivery, and so on didn’t even exist yet! While it was relatively easy to adopt some of its tactical aspects, the strategic side of DDD was still seen as an unjustifiable overhead for the most part.</p>
			<p>Fast-forwarding to today, we are building our most complex software solutions ever, with even more complex organization and team structures to cope. Also, the use of the public cloud is almost a given. This has given rise to a situation where distributed teams and applications are almost a norm. Also, we are also in an age where applications from an earlier generation need to be modernized. All this has resulted in the principles of DDD, specifically the strategic elements, gaining a lot of prominence.</p>
			<p>We have been practitioners of these concepts and have gained valuable insights from our experiences. Over the years, we have seen a number of advancements that have made the adoption of DDD at scale a viable option. This book is a distillation of all our collective experiences. While we have drawn a lot of inspiration from earlier works on the subject, we have been very conscious to apply a practitioner’s mindset so that we lower the barrier for teams looking to sustain and thrive in their journey of building complex, distributed software.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-7"><a id="_idTextAnchor006"/>Who this book is for</h1>
			<p>This book was written with a diverse set of roles and skills in mind. While the concepts of DDD have been in existence for a long time, practical application and scaling have been a challenge, arguably due to a dearth of practical techniques, tools, and real-world examples that bring all these concepts together as a cohesive whole. Successful application of these principles requires strong collaboration from a varied set of roles and disciplines across an organization, including executives, business experts, product owners, business analysts, architects, developers, testers, and operators.</p>
			<p>Here is a quick summary of reader personas and what they will gain from reading this book: </p>
			<p><strong class="bold">Executives and business experts</strong> should read this book so that they can articulate their vision and the core concepts that justify the need for the solution. Techniques will allow them to do this in an expedient manner and also gain empathy toward what it takes to implement changes quickly and reliably.</p>
			<p><strong class="bold">Product owners</strong> should read this book so that they can act as effective facilitators when communicating with both business and technical team members, making sure that there is no loss in translation.</p>
			<p><strong class="bold">Architects</strong> should read this book so that they gain an appreciation of the fact that it is of utmost importance to understand the problem before thinking of a solution. They will also gain an appreciation of various architecture patterns and how they play in conjunction with DDD principles.</p>
			<p><strong class="bold">Developers and testers</strong> will be able to put their knowledge to work with this practical guide to create elegant software designs that are easy and pleasant to work with and reason about.</p>
			<p>The book provides a hands-on approach to gathering requirements effectively, promoting a shared understanding among all team members in order to implement solutions that will be able to withstand the test of a dynamically evolving business ecosystem.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-8"><a id="_idTextAnchor007"/>What this book covers</h1>
			<p><a href="B16716_01_Final_NM_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor015"><em class="italic">Chapter 1</em></a>, <em class="italic">The Rationale for Domain-Driven Design</em>, examines how the practice of DDD provides a set of guidelines and techniques to improve the odds of success in our favor. We will look at how Eric Evans’ classic book on the subject from 2003 is extremely relevant today. We will also introduce the elements of strategic and tactical DDD.</p>
			<p><a href="B16716_02_Final_NM_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor037"><em class="italic">Chapter 2</em></a>, <em class="italic">Where and How Does DDD Fit?</em>, examines how DDD compares with several of these architecture styles and how/where it fits in the overall scheme of things when crafting a software solution.</p>
			<p><a href="B16716_03_Final_NM_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor054"><em class="italic">Chapter 3</em></a>, <em class="italic">Understanding the Domain</em>, introduces the sample domain (International Trade) at a fictitious KP bank. We also examine how we can get started with strategic design using techniques like business model canvas, impact maps, and Wardley maps.</p>
			<p><a href="B16716_04_Final_NM_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor065"><em class="italic">Chapter 4</em></a>, <em class="italic">Domain Analysis and Modeling</em>, continues the analysis and modeling of the sample problem domain – Letter of Credit (LC) application, by using techniques like domain storytelling and eventstorming to arrive at a shared understanding of the problem and brainstorm ideas to arrive at a solution.</p>
			<p><a href="B16716_05_Final_NM_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor077"><em class="italic">Chapter 5</em></a>, <em class="italic">Implementing Domain Logic</em>, implements the command-side API for the sample application. We will look at how we can employ an event-driven architecture to build loosely coupled components. We will also look at how to implement structural and business validations and persistence options by contrasting state-stored and event-sourced aggregates.</p>
			<p><a href="B16716_06_Final_NM_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor097"><em class="italic">Chapter 6</em></a>, <em class="italic">Implementing the User Interface – Task-Based</em>, designs the <strong class="bold">user interace</strong> (<strong class="bold">UI</strong>) for the sample application. We will also express expectations of the UI to the service implementation.</p>
			<p><a href="B16716_07_Final_NM_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor112"><em class="italic">Chapter 7</em></a>, <em class="italic">Implementing Queries</em>, dives deeper into how we can construct read-optimized representations of data by listening to domain events. We will also look at persistence options for these read models.</p>
			<p><a href="B16716_08_Final_NM_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor129"><em class="italic">Chapter 8</em></a>, <em class="italic">Implementing Long-Running Workflows</em>, looks at implementing both long-running user operations (sagas) and deadlines. We will also look at how we can keep track of the overall flow using log aggregation and distributed tracing. We will round off by looking at when/whether to choose explicit orchestration components of implicit choreography.</p>
			<p><a href="B16716_09_Final_NM_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor138"><em class="italic">Chapter 9</em></a>, <em class="italic">Integrating with External Systems</em>, looks at integrating with other systems and bounded contexts. We will present the various styles of integration and the implications of choosing each of these.</p>
			<p><a href="B16716_10_Final_NM_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor150"><em class="italic">Chapter 10</em></a>, <em class="italic">Beginning the Decomposition Journey</em>, decomposes the command and the query side of the sample-bounded context into distinct components. We will look at the trade-offs involved when making these choices.</p>
			<p><a href="B16716_11_Final_NM_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor164"><em class="italic">Chapter 11</em></a>, <em class="italic">Decomposing into Finer-Grained Components</em>, looks at finer-grained decomposition and the trade-offs involved beyond the technical implications. We will decompose our application into distinct functions and discuss where it might be appropriate to draw the line.</p>
			<p><a href="B16716_12_Final_NM_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor176"><em class="italic">Chapter 12</em></a>, <em class="italic">Beyond Functional Requirements</em>, looks at factors beyond business requirements that can play a significant role in how applications are decomposed. Specifically, we will examine the effect that cross-functional requirements play when applying DDD.</p>
