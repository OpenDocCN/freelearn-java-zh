    inevitable in a distributed environment. In order to do that, we will introduce
    the **circuit breaker** architectural pattern and cover when it should be used,
    and what its benefits are. We will look at its Netflix implementation, **Hystrix**.
    We will also cover how it is implemented and how it can be used. As an example,
    we will use Hystrix to add resilience and fault tolerance to our sample application.

    consideration that invocations of the services will be performed over the network.
    As a result, the application must be prepared to deal with network failures, which
    will certainly happen.

    can poison a large number of services. Let's take a look at the number of scenarios,
    that can make this possible.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In large distributed systems, each service would have a large number of dependencies
    on other services. It requires only one dependency to fail to make the service
    irresponsible. Also, a service will go down too, becoming unavailable for other
    services that depend on it. Such a situation is known as cascading failures (Further
    reading, link 1).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: However, that's not all. In a production-ready environment when there are a
    lot of calls being performed, a service that has latency problems will quickly
    block all available threads and make all other services unreachable.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Clearly, if we want to design a robust distributed system, we will need to have
    a tool that will enable users to deal with the problems described previously.
    The tool that we will use is the Hystrix library.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    to provide robustness for its sophisticated distributed architecture. Let's find
    out how Hystrix deals with the problems previously described.

- en: 'The architectural design pattern created to deal with the problems described
    previously is the circuit breaker pattern. The main idea behind it is simple:
    wrap the invocation code into the command, which will perform the invocation,
    and calculate the status of the remote service. If the service is declared unreachable
    by the metrics used by the command, then the next invocations are rejected immediately.
    After a given time, new connections will be tried again, and, if successful, the
    command will start performing invocations to the service again.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The name of the pattern was taken from the electrical circuit breaker, a device
    used to protect the electrical circuit from the damage that may result from the
    excess electrical current. If the current in the circuit is too high then the
    circuit breaker opens, preventing the current from flowing. In order to make the
    circuit operate again, the circuit breaker has to be closed.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Owing to its archetype, the software circuit breaker has inherited the electrical
    nomenclature. If the targeted service is healthy and the invocations are forwarded
    to it directly, we will be talking about closed breaker. If the health metrics
    are exceed, the invocations are not performed, and the circuit breaker will be
    opened.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Obviously, the library that is responsible for the implementation of the circuit
    breaker has to provide algorithms that decide whether the remote service is healthy,
    how and when to open the circuit, and what to do if a circuit breaker is closed.
    Let's discuss how Hystrix does it.

- en: During the invocation of the remote service, Hystrix checks whether the circuit
    breaker is open. This decision is made based on the statistics gathered from the
    recent invocations. If the percentage of failures in the last time window is lower
    than the configured threshold, then the circuit is open and the invocation is
    performed.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: After the invocation is performed, the circuit breaker stores its result (success/failure)
    in the statistics. The statistics are gathered for the configured time window,
    which is further divided into the number of buckets, with only one bucket being
    discarded at a time so that the data for the given window is not discarded all
    at once.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: What happens when the circuit is open? Firstly, the algorithm checks whether
    the configured sleep time has passed. If it is the case, then only one request
    is allowed to be executed. This stage of a circuit breaker is called half-open
    and its purpose is to check whether the invoked service is healthy again. If the
    invocation succeeds, then a circuit breaker is opened again and the metrics are
    reset. If, on the other hand, the sleep time has not exceeded or the one invocation
    in a half-open state has failed, then the circuit breaker is opened again and
    the sleep time is reset.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So, we now know the Hystrix circuit breaker algorithm and how it reacts to statistics
    on successful and failed invocation. However, how do we actually define failure?
    There are three cases when the invocation is marked as failed. First, the configured
    invocation timeout has been exceeded. Second, the client library has thrown an
    exception. Third, the number of threads available for a given dependency has been
    exceeded.
  prefs: []

    more about it.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In order to prevent a situation in which one of the dependencies uses the whole
    thread pool of an application, Hystrix keeps the thread pool for each dependency.
    If one of the dependencies becomes latent, it will keep all its threads busy and
    will reject further invocations, resulting in an increased failure count. Such
    a strategy is called **bulkheading**.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'This time, the nomenclature is taken from ship engineering: the hull of the
    ship is divided into isolated bulkheads so that the hull damage in one place results
    in only one bulkhead being filled with water. Similarly, providing a thread pool
    for each of the dependencies results in only a dedicated thread pool being used
    if one of the services is misbehaving.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In complex distributed environments, it is often the case that the application
    has many dependencies, each of which depends on other client libraries. Often,
    such libraries are black boxes provided by a third-party company, making them
    hard to debug. In addition, increasing the number of those libraries increases
    the risk that one of them will *poison* the whole application. With bulkheading,
    you can easily mitigate this risk.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The state of each client can be easily tracked by the status of its thread pool.
    If monitoring shows that one of the thread pools is full, it is an indicator that
    it should be examined. If the underlying problem is fixed, the thread pool will
    clear up and the service will continue its operation.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The dependencies that share the same thread pool are configurable. As a result,
    you are able to tune bulkheading behavior according to your architecture. Such
    a configuration is done using Hystrix group mechanism, which we will show you
    in the examples later in this chapter.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So, we already know that the invocation may fail or be forced to fail by Hystrix.
    But, what happens in that scenario? The mechanism that is supposed to deal with
    invocation failures is called **fallbacks**. Let's learn more about it now.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Fallbacks
  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Hystrix implements a fallbacks mechanism, which allows you to execute your code
    whenever the failure of the invocation happens. The command allows you to implement
    a fallback method, which will be executed during the failure. The method is executed
    regardless of the cause of the failure—the same method will be executed in case
    of timeout or thread pool overflow.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The fallback method doesn't have to be implemented. If fallback is not implemented,
    the exception thrown by Hystrix will be propagated down the stack trace.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If, on the other hand, you decide to implement the fallback, you have a number
    of strategies for doing that. Let's take a look at a few examples.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you are using a service that is used to read a data, you can return an empty
    answer in case of invocation failure. In such a scenario, no data will be available
    in case of service failure. This solution hides the underlying failure and immediately
    returns the response. The problem is, obviously, that the requested data is unavailable.
    You can deal with that by implementing the local cache and return the latest response
    in case of failure. In this scenario, the failure will be hidden and the data
    will be available. It won't be up to date for the time of failure, but it will
    allow your system to continue its operation.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Let's suppose now that you are using the authorization service to decide whether
    the user is authorized to perform some further operations. In this case, you can
    implement the fallback, which will always return the same response. However, what
    should this response be? As usual, it depends on your use case. In some scenarios,
    you may want to avoid a situation when a user who has paid for a service is unable
    to use it. In this scenario, you would return the successful authorization each
    time. The drawback is that a number of users will be able to use content that
    they haven't paid for at the time of authorization service failure. In other scenarios,
    you may need to deny authorization for all users. Surely the temporary allow-all
    strategy is not suitable for the bank application. In this case, you would have
    to deny the authorization for all users.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'Finally, in some scenarios, not writing the fallback is a good strategy. Let''s
    suppose that you are implementing an invocation that is supposed to modify some
    data as a part of transactional operations. In this scenario, the propagated exception
    is the strategy that we want: the whole operation will be stopped, and the exception
    will be propagated to the transaction manager, which will roll back the transaction.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In this section, we have only hinted at a number of possible fallback implementation
    strategies. As you may have noticed, the specific implementation (or lack of)
    depends directly on your service's business requirements. The key point to remember
    is that Hystrix won't allow the network failure to compromise the behavior of
    your application, and if a failure occurs it will allow you to deal with it using
    the fallback mechanism.

- en: At the beginning, the user constructs the command and starts its execution.
    Hystrix checks whether the circuit breaker associated with this command is closed.
    If the circuit breaker is open, then the invocation will be rejected immediately
    and the fallback will be executed (if implemented). If the circuit breaker is
    closed, then the thread-pool is checked. If there are no available threads in
    the thread-pool, then the invocation fails; optionally, the fallback is executed
    and the failure is reported to the circuit breaker. If, on the other hand, there
    are threads available, then the invocation starts. If the invocation misses its
    timeout, then the failure is reported to the circuit breaker and the optional
    fallback is executed.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In this scenario, the thread may be blocked. Hystrix will time it out, but will
    have to wait for the client library to *return the thread*. If the invocation
    finishes and fails, then the failure is reported to the circuit breaker and optionally
    the fallback is executed.
