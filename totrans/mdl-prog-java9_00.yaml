- en: Modularity is coming to Java with Java 9, and it's a big deal! Unlike other
    Java releases that come with added features to the language that you can optionally
    use in your code, the Java Platform Modular System is a complete change in the
    way we think about, design, and write Java applications.

- en: This book is a detailed guide and a hands-on companion to help you learn about
    and write modular code in Java. After reading and working through the code in
    this book, you'll have a deep understanding of Java 9 modularity, its features,
    the impact on the platform, and how you can use this new paradigm to build modular
    applications yourself.

- en: This book has been carefully designed to provide a gentle introduction to the
    topics, while gradually ramping up the scope and complexity of the topics covered.
    This is not a reference book. For example, when I introduce a concept or a feature,
    I don't provide all possible details or syntax combinations in an attempt to be
    comprehensive. My primary goal while writing this book is to help you grasp the
    concepts and gain a deep understanding of Java modularity. The ordering of topics
    and discussions in this book has been carefully crafted to make sure you always
    have the necessary knowledge to understand the topic being covered. Thus, this
    book benefits greatly from being read sequentially. Having said that, if you are
    already aware of some of the topics and you want to jump to a specific topic,
    you should be able to do that too. A handy index is provided at the end of the
    book for this purpose.

- en: '[Chapter 1](part0021.html#K0RQ0-ed2405f4162b4f86b565edd6b6d679fb), *Introducing
    Java 9 Modularity*, covers the status quo of code structuring and management in
    Java 8 and before. It outlines the challenges and pitfalls in maintaining and
    organizing large code bases over time, with the example of a large Java code base
    everyone is familiar with--the JDK. It then introduces Project Jigsaw and explains
    how the concept of modularity attempts to solve the challenges outlined in the
    previous chapter. It discusses the module-based changes to the JDK structure as
    well as the ability to create modules in application code.'

    Your First Java Module*, gets you started on a sample code project that is written
    without using the module construct. It then guides you step-by-step through creating
    your first Java 9 module. It introduces you to the module keyword, the module-info.java
    class and how to define a custom Java module. It then covers compiling and running
    a module. It explains the structure of the .class files and how the runtime uses
    the same module definition to infer the module structure.'

    Inter-Module Dependencies*, shows how modules can hardly work well in isolation.
    They are designed to be parts of a bigger unit and are meant to work with each
    other. This chapter covers creating a second module and having the modules depend
    on each other. You''ll learn how to define such a relationship in Java 9, as well
    as how to compile and run a multi-module application.'

    the Modular JDK*, switches our attention to the Java platform, specifically the
    JDK. You''ll learn about the important changes to the JDK that has resulted from
    the modularization of the platform. You''ll learn about the modules that come
    out of the box with the JDK. You''ll also learn about the tools and techniques
    to browse and get more information about any of those modules.'

    through a hands-on step-by-step guide. You''ll understand some of the challenges
    that you may typically face when depending on platform modules and how to solve
    them.'

    and how you can control the level of encapsulation for their modules and libraries.
    It continues the module resolution discussion of the previous chapter by adding
    two new criteria that influences the encapsulation and availability of Java elements--accessibility
    and readability.'

    in the sample application and how that prevents the extensibility and "plugging-in"
    of new modules. It explains the new Java 9 services, provides step-by-step instructions
    to encapsulate implementation classes, and uses ServiceLoader to look them up.'

    process and what happens during it. It explains how linking plays an important
    part when developing modules in Java 9\. It then provides step-by-step instructions
    to create a runtime image for the sample project, how to optimize it, and how
    to execute the image.'

    building modular applications in Java. Now that you have a good understanding
    of the Java module system features and how it works, the next question is when
    and how to use them? You''ll learn how to establish module scopes and boundaries,
    how to define good module interfaces, and how to tackle some common challenges

    in Java 7) ready to be migrated to Java 9\. It illustrates the optional nature
    of Java modules and how a classpath-based code is automatically assigned to an
    "unnamed" module. It then provides step-by-step instructions to get legacy code

    features of Java 9\. You''ll learn how to form a migration strategy for your code,
    as well as how to deal with dependencies that are not compatible with Java 9\.
    You''ll learn how to use Java 9 features that are designed to assist such migration,
