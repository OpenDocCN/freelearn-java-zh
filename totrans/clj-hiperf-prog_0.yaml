- en: Since the first edition of this book was published in November 2013, Clojure
    has seen a much wider adoption and has witnessed many success stories. The newer
    versions of Clojure fortify its performance story while staying close to its roots—simplicity
    and pragmatism. This edition significantly updates the book for Clojure 1.7, and
    adds a new chapter on the performance measurement.

- en: The Java Virtual Machine plays a huge role in the performance of the Clojure
    programs. This edition of the book increases the focus on the JVM tools for performance
    management, and it explores how to use those. This book is updated to use Java
    8, though it also highlights the places where features from Java 7 or 8 have been
    used.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This book is updated mainly to be more of practical use to the readers. I hope
    that this edition will better equip the readers with performance measurement and
    profiling tools and with the know-how of analyzing and tuning the performance
    characteristics of Clojure code.

    Design*, classifies the various use cases with respect to performance, and analyzes
    how to interpret their performance aspects and needs.'

    is a guided tour of various Clojure data structures, abstractions (persistent
    data structures, vars, macros, transducers, and so on), and their performance
    characteristics.'

    how to enhance performance by using Java interoperability and features from Clojure.'

    how the host stack impacts performance. Being a hosted language, Clojure has its
    performance directly related to the host.'

    chapter that discusses the concurrency and parallelism features in Clojure and
    JVM. Concurrency is an increasingly significant way to derive performance.'

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You should acquire Java Development Kit version 8 or higher for your operating
    system to work through all the examples. This book discusses the Oracle HotSpot
    JVM, so you may want to get Oracle JDK or OpenJDK (or Zulu) if possible. You should
    also get the latest Leiningen version (2.5.2 as of the time of writing) from [http://leiningen.org/](http://leiningen.org/),
    and JD-GUI from [http://jd.benow.ca/](http://jd.benow.ca/).

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This book is for intermediate Clojure programmers who are interested in learning
    how to write high-performance code. If you are an absolute beginner in Clojure,
    you should learn the basics of the language first, and then come back to this
    book. You need not be well-versed in performance engineering or Java. However,
    some prior knowledge of Java would make it much easier to understand the Java-related
    chapters.
