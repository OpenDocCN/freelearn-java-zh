- en: Scala is a type-safe JVM language that incorporates both object-oriented and
    functional programming into an extremely concise, logical, and extraordinarily
    powerful language. Some may be surprised to know that Scala is not quite as new
    as they may have thought, having first been introduced in 2003\. However, it is
    in the past few years in particular that Scala has begun to develop a significant
    following.

- en: '[Chapter 1](ch01.html "Chapter 1. Setting up the Development Environment"),
    *Setting up the Development Environment*, shows you how to set up your development
    environment. You''ll learn the basics of Scala, such as what the simple Scala
    program looks like and what a typical developer flow is. It''ll also cover some
    aspects of testing your Scala program by using unit testing.'

- en: '[Chapter 2](ch02.html "Chapter 2. Basic Language Features"), *Basic Language
    Features*, covers classes and objects, traits, pattern matching, case class, and
    so on. You''ll also implement your chatbot application by applying the object
    oriented concepts.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[Chapter 3](ch03.html "Chapter 3. Functions"), *Functions*, covers functional
    programming with Scala and how object- oriented and functional approaches complete
    each other. You''ll identify generic classes and also identify how to create user-defined
    pattern matching and why is it useful.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[Chapter 4](ch04.html "Chapter 4. Scala Collections"), *Scala Collections*,
    teaches you how to work with lists. Then, it covers some more relevant data structures.
    Finally, you''ll look at how collections relate to monads and how you can use
    that knowledge to make some powerful abstractions in your code.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[Chapter 5](ch05.html "Chapter 5. Scala Type System"), *Scala Type System*,
    covers the type system and polymorphism. It''ll also enable you to identify the
    different types of variance, which provides a way to constrain parameterized types.
    Then, you''ll cover some advanced types such as abstract type members and option.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[Chapter 6](ch06.html "Chapter 6. Implicits"), *Implicits*, covers implicit
    parameters and implicit conversions. You''ll be learning about how they work,
    how to use them, and what kind of benefits and perils they provide.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[Chapter 7](ch07.html "Chapter 7. Functional Idioms"), *Functional Idioms*,
    covers the core concepts of functional programming like Pure functions, immutability,
    and higher-order functions. It''ll also cover two popular functional programming
    libraries called Cats and Doobie, and use them to write some interesting programs.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[Chapter 8](ch08.html "Chapter 8. Domain Specific Languages"), *Domain Specifc
    Languages*, covers how Scala makes it possible to write powerful DSLs by providing
    a few interesting language features. Then, it''ll cover a DSL that you''ll very
    likely be using if you''re going to work with Scala professionally.'
