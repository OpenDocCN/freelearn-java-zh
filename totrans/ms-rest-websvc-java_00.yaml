- en: This book is a practical guide to designing, building, documenting, testing,
    and deploying RESTful APIs using modern Java frameworks. REST APIs have become
    a standard way of enabling communication between systems, especially in microservices
    and other distributed architectures. With Java being one of the most widely used
    languages for backend development, understanding how to build effective APIs with
    Java is a key skill for today’s developers.

    OpenAPI, and other popular tools and libraries. You’ll also gain exposure to containerization,
    observability, API security, and performance tuning – everything you need to create
    robust, scalable, and maintainable APIs. Whether you’re working in a start-up
    or an enterprise, the skills covered here will help you deliver high-quality backend
    services that meet modern development standards.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[*Chapter 1*](B21843_01.xhtml#_idTextAnchor015) , *Understanding RESTful Core
    Concepts* , introduces the foundational principles of REST architecture and explains
    the different maturity levels of RESTful APIs. It also covers the role of JSON
    as a standard data format, outlines practical guidelines for designing effective
    APIs, and explores common use cases where REST is applied in real-world systems.'

- en: '[*Chapter 2*](B21843_02.xhtml#_idTextAnchor050) , *Exposing a RESTful API with
    Spring* , focuses on designing and implementing a RESTful API using Spring Boot.
    You’ll begin by designing a simple Product API, then move on to building it step
    by step with Spring Boot, one of the most popular frameworks for Java-based web
    applications. This chapter provides hands-on experience in turning REST concepts
    into a working API.'

- en: '[*Chapter 3*](B21843_03.xhtml#_idTextAnchor076) , *Documenting Your API Effectively*
    , explores the importance of clear and accurate API documentation in building
    reliable and maintainable services. You’ll learn how to use OpenAPI to standardize
    your API documentation and understand the differences between specification-first
    and code-first approaches. The chapter also walks you through documenting the
    Product API introduced earlier, ensuring it is both understandable and usable
    by other developers and systems.'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[*Chapter 4*](B21843_04.xhtml#_idTextAnchor096) , *Generating Code from OpenAPI*
    , guides you through creating a full API based on an OpenAPI specification. You’ll
    start by defining the Order Management API specification, then generate the necessary
    code to jumpstart development. The chapter also covers organizing the project’s
    package structure, implementing the API controller, and integrating the Order
    Management API and the Product API introduced earlier.'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[*Chapter 5*](B21843_05.xhtml#_idTextAnchor116) , *Managing API Evolution*
    , shows how to handle changes and updates to your APIs without disrupting existing
    users. You’ll learn about different versioning strategies, see how to implement
    versioning in the Product API, and explore best practices for managing API evolution
    to ensure your services remain reliable and backwards compatible.'

- en: '[*Chapter 6*](B21843_06.xhtml#_idTextAnchor135) , *Advanced API Concepts and
    Implementations* , dives into key techniques for building robust and user-friendly
    APIs. You’ll explore advanced data handling methods such as pagination, filtering,
    and file upload/download through REST APIs. The chapter also covers HATEOAS to
    improve API navigation and introduces resilience patterns to make your APIs more
    reliable and fault-tolerant in real-world scenarios.'

    , focuses on protecting your APIs from unauthorized access and security threats.
    You’ll learn about authentication and authorization techniques, explore key security
    principles from OWASP, and understand how to address common vulnerabilities through
    the management of **Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures** ( **CVEs** ) to keep
    your APIs safe and trustworthy.'

    APIs* , explores both traditional API testing methods and the exciting impact
    of generative AI on the testing process. You’ll learn how AI tools such as ChatGPT
    are transforming test creation, making it faster, smarter, and more effective,
    while still covering essential testing types, tools, and best practices for building
    reliable APIs.'

    , dives into best practices for logging and tracing in RESTful APIs. You’ll learn
    how structured logging, correlation IDs, and centralized filters help with effective
    troubleshooting, while distributed tracing tools such as Micrometer and OpenTelemetry
    provide deep visibility into service performance and request flows across distributed
    systems.'
