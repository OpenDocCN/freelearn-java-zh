    technologies and demonstrates how the JavaFX kit can be used to create a GUI application.
    The latest versions of JavaFX not only provide many helpful features but also
    allow for the preserving and embedding of legacy implementations and styles.

- en: In a certain respect, the GUI is the most important part of an application.
    It directly interacts with the user. If the GUI is inconvenient, unappealing to
    the eye, or confusing, even the best backend solution might not persuade the user
    to use this application. By contrast, a well-thought-out, intuitive, and nicely
    designed GUI helps to retain users, even if the application does not do the job
    as well as its competitors.

    It implies *the classes that are at the foundation of Java*, while, in fact, JFC
    includes only classes and interfaces related to the GUI. To be precise, JFC is
    a collection of three frameworks: the **Abstract Window Toolkit** (**AWT**), Swing,
    and Java 2D.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: JFC is part of **Java Class Library** (**JCL**), although the name JFC came
    into being only in 1997, while AWT was part of JCL from the very beginning. At
    that time, Netscape developed a GUI library called **Internet Foundation Classes**
    (**IFC**), and Microsoft created **Application Foundation Classes** (**AFC**)
    for GUI development, too. So, when Sun Microsystems and Netscape decided to form
    a new GUI library, they inherited the word *Foundation* and created JFC. The Swing
    framework took over the Java GUI programming from AWT and was successfully used
    for almost two decades.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A new GUI programming toolkit, JavaFX, was added to JCL in Java 8\. It was removed
    from JCL in Java 11, and since then, has resided as an open source project supported
    by the company Gluon as a downloadable module in addition to the JDK. JavaFX uses
    a somewhat different approach to GUI programming than AWT and Swing. It presents
    a more consistent and simpler design and has a good chance of being a winning
    Java GUI-programming toolkit.

    who live there cannot avoid hearing about new plays and productions released almost
    every week. It makes them inevitably familiar with theater terminology, in which
    the terms *stage*, *scene*, and *event* are probably used most often. These three
    terms are at the foundation of a JavaFX application structure, too.
  prefs: []

- en: The top-level container in JavaFX that holds all other components is represented
    by the `javafx.stage.Stage` class. So, you can say that, in the JavaFX application,
    everything happens on a *stage*. From a user perspective, it is a display area
    or window where all the controls and components perform their actions (like actors
    in a theater). And, similar to the actors in a theater, they do it in the context
    of a *scene*, represented by the `javafx.scene.Scene` class. So, a JavaFX application,
    like a play in a theater, is composed of `Scene` objects presented inside the
    `Stage` object one at a time. Each `Scene` object contains a graph that defines
    the positions of the scene actors (called `javafx.scene.Node`.

    The documentation includes the description and user manual of Scene Builder (a
    development tool that provides a visual layout environment and lets you quickly
    design a user interface for the JavaFX application without writing any code).
    This tool may be useful for creating a complex and intricate GUI, and many people
    use it all the time. In this book though, we will concentrate on JavaFX code writing
    without using this tool.

    you can design a user interface without even writing one line of Java code.'
  prefs: []

- en: FXML does not have a schema, but its capabilities reflect the API of the JavaFX
    objects used to build a scene. This means you can use the API documentation to
    understand what tags and attributes are allowed in the FXML structure. Most of
    the time, JavaFX classes can be used as tags and their properties as attributes.
  prefs: []

- en: In addition to the FXML file (the view), the controller (Java class) can be
    used for processing the model and organizing the page flow. The model consists
    of domain objects managed by the view and the controller. It also allows using
    all the power of CSS styling and JavaScript. But, in this book, we will be able
    to demonstrate only the basic FXML capabilities. The rest you can find in the
    FXML introduction ([https://docs.oracle.com/javafx/2/api/javafx/fxml/doc-files/introduction_to_fxml.html](https://docs.oracle.com/javafx/2/api/javafx/fxml/doc-files/introduction_to_fxml.html))

- en: To add HTML to JavaFX is easy. All you have to do is to use the `javafx.scene.web.WebView`
    class, which provides a window where the added HTML is rendered similar to how
    it happens in a browser. The `WebView` class uses WebKit, the open source browser
    engine, and thus supports full browsing functionality.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Like all other JavaFX components, the `WebView` class extends the `Node` class
    and can be treated in the Java code as such. In addition, it has its own properties
    and methods that allow adjusting the browser window to the encompassing application
    by setting the window size (maximum, minimum, and preferred height and width),
    font scale, zoom rate, adding CSS, enabling the context (right-click) menu, and
    similar. The `getEngine()` method returns a `javafx.scene.web.WebEngine` object
    associated with it. It provides the ability to load HTML pages, navigate them,
    apply different styles to the loaded pages, access their browsing history and
    the document model, and execute JavaScript.

    object is constructed based on the `Media` object and then set as a property of
    the `MediaView` class constructor. The `MediaView` object is set on the scene
    along with two `Text` objects. We use the `VBox` object to provide the layout.
    Finally, after the scene is set on the stage and the stage becomes visible (after
    the `show()` method completes), the `play()` method is invoked on the `MediaPlayer`
    object. By default, the media is played once.

    the `setEffect(Effect e)` method, which means that any of the effects can be added
    to any node. That is the main way of applying effects to the nodes—the actors
    that produce a scene on a stage (if we recall our analogy introduced at the beginning
    of this chapter).
  prefs: []

- en: The only exception is the `Blend` effect, which makes its usage more complicated
    than the use of other effects. In addition to using the `setEffect(Effect e)`
    method, some of the `Node` class children also have the `setBlendMode(BlendMode
    bm)` method, which allows regulating how the images blend into one another when
    they overlap. So, it is possible to set different blend effects in different ways
    that override one another and produce an unexpected result that may be difficult
    to debug. That is what makes the `Blend` effect usage more complicated, and that
    is why we are going to start the overview with how the `Blend` effect can be used.
