- en: Taking a screenshot of a web page is a very useful capability of WebDriver.
    This is very handy when your test case fails, and you want to see the state of
    the application when the test case failed. The `TakesScreenShot` interface in
    the WebDriver library is implemented by all of the different variants of WebDriver,
    such as Firefox Driver, Internet Explorer Driver, Chrome Driver, and so on.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The `TakesScreenShot` capability is enabled in all of the browsers by default.
    Because this is a read-only capability, a user cannot toggle it. Before we see
    a code example that uses this capability, we should look at an important method
    of the `TakesScreenShot` interface—`getScreenshotAs().`

    WebDriver to output the screenshot in three different formats : `BASE64`, `BYTES`
    (raw data), and `FILE`. If you choose the `FILE` format, it writes the data into
    a `.png` file, which will be deleted once the JVM is killed. So, you should always
    copy that file into a safe location so that it can be used for later reference.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    tabs, and frames used in the application. For example, when you click on an internet
    banking link on a bank web application, it will open the internet banking application
    in a separate window or Tab. At this point, you may want to switch back to the
    original window to handle some events. Similarly, you may have to deal with a
    web application that is divided into two frames on the web page. The frame on
    the left may contain navigation items, and the frame on the right displays the
    appropriate web page, based on what is selected in the frame on the left. Using
    WebDriver, you can develop test cases that can easily handle such complex situations.

    there is an HTML file provided with this book named `Window.html`. It is a very
    basic web page that links to Google's search page. When you click on the link,
    the Google's search page is opened in a different window. Every time you open
    a web page using WebDriver in a browser window, WebDriver assigns a window handle
    to that. WebDriver uses the window handle to identify the window. At this point,
    in WebDriver, there are two window handles registered. Now, on the screen, you
    can see that the Google's search page is in the front and has the focus. At this
    point, if you want to switch to the first browser window, you can use WebDriver's
    `switchTo()` method to do that.

    better control, not just over the web page, but over the browser itself. **Navigate**
    is one such feature of WebDriver that allows the test script developer to work
    with the browser's back, forward, and refresh controls. As users of a web application,
    quite often, we use the browser's back and forward controls to navigate between
    the pages of a single application, or, sometimes, multiple applications. As a
    test-script developer, you may want to develop tests that observe the behavior
    of the application when browser navigation buttons are clicked, especially the
    back button. For example, if you use your navigation button in a banking application,
    the session should expire and the user should be logged out. So, using the WebDriver's
    navigation feature, you can emulate those actions.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you have a previous UI automation experience, I'm sure you would have come
    across a situation where your test script couldn't find an element on the web
    page because the web page was still loading. This could happen due to various
    reasons. One classic example is when the application server or web server is serving
    the page too slowly due to resource constraints; the other could be when you are
    accessing the page on a very slow network. The reason could be that the element
    on the web page is not loaded by the time your test script tries to find it. This
    is where you have to calculate and configure the average wait time for your test
    scripts to wait for WebElements to load on the web page.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: WebDriver provides test-script developers with a very handy feature to manage
    wait time. *Wait time* is the time your driver will wait for the WebElement to
    load, before it gives up and throws `NoSuchElementException`. Remember, in [Chapter
    1](9f647c33-1720-4d7b-973b-7d2ef9dad924.xhtml)*, Introducing WebDriver and WebElements*,
    we discussed the `findElement(By by)` method that throws a   `NoSuchElementException`
    when it cannot find the target WebElement.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There are two ways by which you can make the WebDriver wait for WebElement.
    They are **Implicit Wait** **Time** and **Explicit Wait** **Time**. Implicit timeouts
    are common to all the WebElements and have a global timeout period associated
    with them, but the explicit timeouts can be configured to individual WebElements.
    Let's discuss each of them here.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Implicit wait time
  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Implicit wait time is used when you want to configure the WebDriver's wait time
    as a whole for the application under test. Imagine you have hosted a web application
    on a local server and on a remote server. Obviously, the time to load for a web
    page hosted on a local server would be less than the time for the same page hosted
    on a remote server, due to network latency. Now, if you want to execute your test
    cases against each of them, you may have to configure the wait time accordingly,
    such that your test case doesn't end up spending more time waiting for the page,
    or spend nowhere near enough time, and timeout. To handle these kinds of wait-time
    issues, WebDriver provides an option to set the implicit wait time for all of
    the operations that the driver does using the `manage()` method.
  prefs: []

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[PRE26]'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_PRE
- en: Here, `driver.manage().timeouts()` returns the `WebDriver.Timeouts` interface,
    which declares a method named `implicitlyWait`, which is where you specify the
    amount of time the driver should wait when searching for a WebElement on a web
    page if it is not immediately present. Periodically, the WebDriver will poll for
    the WebElement on the web page, until the maximum wait time specified to the previous
    method is over. In the preceding code, 10 seconds is the maximum wait time your
    driver will wait for any WebElement to load on your browser. If it loads within
    this time period, WebDriver proceeds with the rest of the code; otherwise, it
    will throw `NoSuchElementException`.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Use this method when you want to specify a maximum wait time, which is generally
    common for most of the WebElements on your web application. The various factors
    that influence the performance of your page are network bandwidth, server configuration,
    and so on. Based on those conditions, as a developer of your WebDriver test cases,
    you have to arrive at a value for the maximum implicit wait time, such that your
    test cases don't take too long to execute, and, at the same time, don't timeout
    very frequently.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Explicit wait time
  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Implicit timeout is generic to all the WebElements of a web page. But, if you
    have one specific WebElement in your application, where you want to wait for a
    very long time, this approach may not work. Setting the implicit wait time to
    the value of this very long time period will delay your entire test suite execution.
    So, you have to make an exception for only a particular case, such as this WebElement.
    To handle such scenarios, WebDriver has an explicit wait time for a WebElement.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'So, let''s see how you can wait for a particular WebElement using WebDriver,
    with the following code:'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[PRE27]'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_PRE
- en: The highlighted code is where we have created a conditional wait for a particular
    WebElement. The `ExpectedCondition` interface can be used to apply the conditional
    wait to a WebElement. Here, WebDriver will wait for a maximum of 20 seconds for
    this particular WebElement. The implicit timeout doesn't get applied for this
    WebElement. If the WebElement doesn't load within the 20 seconds maximum wait
    time, as we know, the driver throws a `NoSuchElementException`. Thus, you can
    override the implicit wait time exclusively for the WebElements you think will
    take more time, by using this handy explicit wait time.

    you want to automate, such as searching for products, adding products to the shopping
    cart, checkout, returns, and so on. For all these actions, one common thing is
    to have to log into the demo application in each of the test cases. So, logging
    into the application in every test case of yours will increase the overall test
    execution time significantly. To reduce the execution time of your test cases,
    you can actually skip signing in for every test case. This can be done by signing
    in once and writing all the cookies of that domain into a file. From the next
    login onward, you can actually load the cookies from the file and add them to
    the driver.

    in a file so that our individual test cases read from this file and load that
    information into the driver. Hence, you can skip the login, because once your

    the cookies directly to this session, because it treats those cookies as if they
    were from a different domain. Try removing the previous line of code and execute
    it, and you will see the error. So, initially, you will try to visit the home
