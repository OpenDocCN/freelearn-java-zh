			<h1 id="_idParaDest-37"><a id="_idTextAnchor044"/>Code, Compile, and Execute</h1>
			<p>With Java installed, we are almost ready to look at coding. Before we get to that, though, we need to learn how to code, compile, and execute Java applications. While an <strong class="bold">integrated development environment</strong> (<strong class="bold">IDE</strong>) will likely be what you will use for most of <a id="_idIndexMarker082"/>your work, understanding how to code without the hand-holding of an IDE is what makes the difference between a Java tinkerer and a <span class="No-Break">Java professional.</span></p>
			<p>In this chapter, we will look at working from the command line and then from some of the most widely used IDEs. This chapter will not be a tutorial on IDEs but rather a review of what they offer to a programmer. The fundamental operation of any IDE is very similar to that of the most commonly used IDEs. Before we examine the various ways to use Java, we will look at a small program that we will use. This book is a <em class="italic">Hello World!</em> free zone, which means that example number one does <span class="No-Break">something useful.</span></p>
			<p>The goal of this chapter is to make you familiar with the four approaches to compiling and executing Java code as well as introduce you to the IDE tools available to developers. We will be covering the <span class="No-Break">following topics:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li>The <span class="No-Break">first program</span></li>
				<li>JShell – REPL <span class="No-Break">in Java</span></li>
				<li>The two-step compile and execute process – <strong class="source-inline">javac</strong> <span class="No-Break">and </span><span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">java</strong></span><span class="No-Break">/</span><span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">javaw</strong></span></li>
				<li>Launch Single-File <span class="No-Break">Source-Code Programs</span></li>
				<li>Integrated <span class="No-Break">development environments</span></li>
			</ul>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-38"><a id="_idTextAnchor045"/>Technical requirements</h1>
			<p>To follow the examples in this chapter, you will need <span class="No-Break">the following:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li>Java <span class="No-Break">17 installed</span></li>
				<li>A text editor, such <span class="No-Break">as Notepad</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>You can find the code files for this chapter on GitHub <span class="No-Break">at </span><a href="https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Transitioning-to-Java/tree/chapter02"><span class="No-Break">https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Transitioning-to-Java/tree/chapter02</span></a><span class="No-Break">.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-39"><a id="_idTextAnchor046"/>The first program</h1>
			<p>Before we can<a id="_idIndexMarker083"/> learn how to compile and execute Java code, we need a Java program to work with. Our first program will calculate compound interest. There is a quote attributed to Albert Einstein, who is said to have stated, “<em class="italic">Compound interest is the eighth wonder of the world</em>.” Whether he ever said this remains in doubt. Regardless, calculating interest on interest is one of the most important financial calculations that can be performed. Here is the formula that we <span class="No-Break">will implement:</span></p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer010" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B19088_02_001.jpg" alt=""/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p>Here, <em class="italic">P</em> is the principal amount deposited into a compound interest account, <em class="italic">r</em> is the interest rate typically expressed as an annual rate, <em class="italic">n</em> is the number of compounding periods (if compounded monthly, then the value is 12), and <em class="italic">t</em> is the time the money will compound for. This is expressed in years and must be divided by the number of compounding periods, which, in this case, will also <span class="No-Break">be 12.</span></p>
			<p>In <em class="italic">Part 2</em> of this book, we will examine the syntax and structure of the language. There, we will explore the code of this program. For this reason, we will just use this program, which is simple to understand. You can download it from this book’s <span class="No-Break">GitHub repository.</span></p>
			<p>Here is the code for a simple program in Java that will calculate what a fixed amount of money will be worth after a length of time has passed at a fixed rate <span class="No-Break">of interest:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
import java.text.NumberFormat;
public class CompoundInterest01 {
    private final double principal = 100.0;
    private final double annualInterestRate = 0.05;
    private final double compoundPerTimeUnit = 12.0;
    private final double time = 5.0; // 
    private final NumberFormat currencyFormat;
    private final NumberFormat percentFormat;
    public CompoundInterest01() {
        currencyFormat = 
          NumberFormat.getCurrencyInstance();
        percentFormat = NumberFormat.getPercentInstance();
        percentFormat.setMinimumFractionDigits(0);
        percentFormat.setMaximumFractionDigits(5);
    }
    public void perform() {
        var result = calculateCompoundInterest();
        System.out.printf("If you deposit %s in a savings 
                account " + "that pays %s annual interest 
                compounded monthly%n" + "you will have 
                after %1.0f years %s", 
                currencyFormat.format(principal),
                percentFormat.format(annualInterestRate),
                time, currencyFormat.format(result));
    }
    private double calculateCompoundInterest() {
        var result = principal * Math.pow(1 + 
            annualInterestRate / compoundPerTimeUnit, 
            time * compoundPerTimeUnit);
        return result;
    }
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        var banker = new CompoundInterest01();
        banker.perform();
    }
}</pre>
			<p>All Java programs must consist of at least one structure <a id="_idIndexMarker084"/>known as a <strong class="bold">class</strong>. Whereas C++ allows you to mix the structured style and the object-oriented style, Java requires the <span class="No-Break">latter style.</span></p>
			<p>With that, you’ve seen your first complete Java program. If you are coming from a C++ or C# background, you<a id="_idIndexMarker085"/> likely understand how it works. If you don’t have <a id="_idIndexMarker086"/>an <strong class="bold">object-oriented programming </strong>(<strong class="bold">OOP</strong>) background, you can look at it as a structured program. In <em class="italic">Part 2</em> of this book, we will explore the syntax of Java. Next, we will run this program in three different ways from the <span class="No-Break">command line.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-40"><a id="_idTextAnchor047"/>JShell – REPL in Java</h1>
			<p><strong class="bold">Read-Eval-Print Loop</strong> (<strong class="bold">REPL</strong>) is an<a id="_idIndexMarker087"/> environment <a id="_idIndexMarker088"/>where<a id="_idIndexMarker089"/> code can execute one line at a time. REPL became a standard part of Java in version 9. It is implemented in a tool called JShell. It serves <span class="No-Break">two purposes:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li>It provides an environment for learning Java without any background in programming. </li>
				<li>It provides a way to quickly test concepts, syntax, and libraries. </li>
			</ul>
			<p>As such, you can execute Java code without the need for the usual decorations. </p>
			<p>There are two ways we can use JShell. The first is to just enter the code that’s necessary to use the formula. Imagine that you want to verify the formula for compound interest, as shown in the source code. You can do that by just entering the necessary code to perform the calculation. </p>
			<p>In the following code block, we have entered the four variable declarations with the values required for the calculation, followed by the line of code that performs the calculation and assigns it to <span class="No-Break">a variable:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
private final double principal = 100.0;
private final double annualInterestRate = 0.05;
private final double compoundPerTimeUnit = 12.0;
private final double time = 5.0; // 
var result = principal * Math.pow(1 + annualInterestRate / compoundPerTimeUnit, time * compoundPerTimeUnit);</pre>
			<p>Follow these <a id="_idIndexMarker090"/>steps <a id="_idIndexMarker091"/>in JShell to enter these<a id="_idIndexMarker092"/> five lines <span class="No-Break">of code:</span></p>
			<ol>
				<li>On Windows, open the Command Prompt. If you are working on a macOS/Linux system, go to the Terminal. If necessary, set the <strong class="source-inline">Path</strong> and <strong class="source-inline">JAVA_HOME</strong> values. Then, enter the <strong class="source-inline">jshell</strong> command. The console will look <span class="No-Break">like this:</span></li>
			</ol>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer011" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure_2.1_B19088.jpg" alt="Figure 2.1 – Running JShell"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 2.1 – Running JShell</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="2">Now, we can enter the following five lines <span class="No-Break">of code:</span></li>
			</ol>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer012" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure_2.2_B19088.jpg" alt="Figure 2.2 – Executing one line at a time in JShell "/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 2.2 – Executing one line at a time in JShell </p>
			<p>Note that<a id="_idIndexMarker093"/> each<a id="_idIndexMarker094"/> line is being executed as it<a id="_idIndexMarker095"/> is being entered and JShell reports the value that’s been assigned to each variable. Java does not format values on its own, so the result is a raw floating-point number. </p>
			<p>Can we assume that since it was executed without any errors, the result is correct? Absolutely not! Especially for calculations, you need a second source for the result. This is where a spreadsheet is invaluable. Here is the result of the calculation after using the formula in <span class="No-Break">Microsoft Excel:</span></p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer013" class="IMG---Figure">

				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 2.3 – The compound interest calculation in Excel</p>
			<p>If any errors <a id="_idIndexMarker096"/>occurred<a id="_idIndexMarker097"/> while you entered your code, which <a id="_idIndexMarker098"/>means that your code doesn’t match the result in the spreadsheet, then you can clear everything you entered into JShell with the <strong class="source-inline">/reset</strong> command and start over. JShell always preserves the last piece of code you entered unless you reset it. JShell also maintains a history of everything you entered and is not lost when you use <strong class="source-inline">/reset</strong>. <strong class="bold">History</strong>, which can be accessed with the up and down arrows, will just allow you to enter the code you used previously into what you are currently <span class="No-Break">working on.</span></p>
			<p>The second way that we can use JShell is by using an editor and making an entire program available to the tool. Before we provide JShell with the complete program, we must use the <strong class="source-inline">/reset</strong> command to remove what we entered previously. </p>
			<p>To execute the entire program, follow <span class="No-Break">these steps:</span></p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">JShell has a basic editor that supports multi-line Java code. Use the <strong class="source-inline">/edit</strong> command to open the editor. </li>
				<li>This editor cannot open files, so you will need to open the <strong class="source-inline">CompoundInterest01.java</strong> file in your text editor, copy the file’s contents, and paste it into the JShell editor. </li>
				<li>When you click on <strong class="bold">Accept</strong>, the code from the JShell editor will be transferred <span class="No-Break">to JShell:</span></li>
			</ol>
			<div>

			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 2.4 – The program after being pasted into the default JShell editor</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="4">Now, you<a id="_idIndexMarker099"/> must click <strong class="bold">Exit</strong> to leave the<a id="_idIndexMarker100"/> editor, which <a id="_idIndexMarker101"/>will restore the JShell prompt. </li>
				<li>Now, you can run the <strong class="source-inline">main</strong> method by entering <strong class="source-inline">CompoundInterest01.main(null)</strong> in the JShell prompt, which will cause the program to execute. The <strong class="source-inline">main</strong> method expects a parameter. Should you not have a parameter to pass to the <strong class="source-inline">main</strong> method, then you will automatically pass null:  </li>

			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 2.5 – Running the program in JShell after it has been transferred from the editor</p>
			<p>You do not have<a id="_idIndexMarker102"/> to use <a id="_idIndexMarker103"/>the<a id="_idIndexMarker104"/> basic editor in <strong class="bold">JShell</strong>. Here, you can use the <strong class="source-inline">/set editor</strong> command and include the path to the editor of your choice, as shown in the <span class="No-Break">following screenshot:</span></p>

			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 2.6 – Changing the editor in JShell</p>
			<p>Here, I have set the editor to Notepad++ for Windows. Note that there are double backslashes for the path separators in the <strong class="source-inline">/set editor</strong> command as it is being entered on a Windows system. On a Linux or Mac system, the path separator is a forward slash and is not doubled. As there are spaces in the path, they must be enclosed in quotation marks. </p>
			<p>When using an external editor with JShell, you must exit the editor to transfer what you have typed to JShell. This is because there is no <span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Accept</em></span><span class="No-Break"> button.</span></p>
			<p>The JShell tool can be useful for testing or learning a new feature or syntax in Java. It can also be quite useful<a id="_idIndexMarker105"/> for<a id="_idIndexMarker106"/> teaching Java to absolute <a id="_idIndexMarker107"/>beginners. Familiarize yourself with this tool as soon <span class="No-Break">as possible.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-41"><a id="_idTextAnchor048"/>The two-step compile and execute process – javac and java/javaw</h1>
			<p>The most <a id="_idIndexMarker108"/>common <a id="_idIndexMarker109"/>approach to <a id="_idIndexMarker110"/>running<a id="_idIndexMarker111"/> a Java program involves two steps. First, you must compile the code with javac and then execute the code <a id="_idIndexMarker112"/>in the <strong class="bold">Java Virtual Machine</strong> (<strong class="bold">JVM</strong>) with Java or on Windows <span class="No-Break">with javaw.</span></p>
			<p>The first step of preparing Java source code for execution is to compile it into <strong class="bold">bytecode</strong>. This<a id="_idIndexMarker113"/> is the machine language of the JVM. Every Java source file that is part of an application must be compiled into bytecode. </p>
			<p>The second step is to execute the bytecode in a JVM. Unlike C or C++, there is no link step. The link step combines all compiled code into a single executable file. In Java, all the bytecode files must be on the classpath, which is the path to all bytecode files, and not necessarily combined into a single file. This may seem confusing as there is a tool called <strong class="bold">jlink</strong>, but <a id="_idIndexMarker114"/>its purpose is to combine the Java runtime with your code so that the end user does not need the Java version that was previously installed on their computer. We will examine <strong class="bold">jlink</strong> in <a href="B19088_16.xhtml#_idTextAnchor315"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 16</em></span></a>, <em class="italic">Deploying Java in Standalone Packages </em><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">and Containers</em></span><span class="No-Break">.</span></p>
			<p>Let us compile and execute our <strong class="source-inline">CompoundInterest01</strong> program: </p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">First, place the <strong class="source-inline">CompoundInterest01.java</strong> file in a folder of its own. This is not a requirement, but it is easier to manage the code if it has its <span class="No-Break">own folder.</span></li>
				<li>Now, open a console in that folder; if you are not using an admin installation of Java, set the <strong class="source-inline">Path</strong> and <strong class="source-inline">JAVA_HOME</strong> properties as shown in the previous chapter. Now, you can compile the program with <span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">javac CompoundInterest01.java</strong></span><span class="No-Break">:</span></li>
			</ol>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer017" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure_2.7_B19088.jpg" alt="Figure 2.7 – Compiling the Java program"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 2.7 – Compiling the Java program</p>
			<p>If <a id="_idIndexMarker115"/>compiling <a id="_idIndexMarker116"/>your <a id="_idIndexMarker117"/>code<a id="_idIndexMarker118"/> does <a id="_idIndexMarker119"/>not result in any errors, then the compiler will not display anything in the console. The folder will now contain a new file called <strong class="source-inline">CompoundInterest01.class</strong>. Notice that it is larger than the Java source code file. </p>
			<p>A Java class file contains the necessary <strong class="bold">bytecode</strong> and source code. The presence of the source code in this file supports the concepts of <strong class="bold">reflection</strong> and <strong class="bold">introspection</strong>. </p>
			<p>Introspection allows you to write code that can examine the type or properties of an object at runtime, whereas reflection allows you to write code that can examine and modify the structure of an object at runtime. These two features are rarely used in business <span class="No-Break">programming. .</span></p>
			<ol>
				<li value="3">With the code compiled, we can run it. Here, we are using the <strong class="source-inline">java</strong> executable to run our program. </li>
			</ol>
			<p>A common myth is to believe that the <strong class="source-inline">java</strong> executable is the JVM. It is not. It is the loader of the JVM, made up of other files that are part of the installation of the JDK. The JVM utilizes its <strong class="source-inline">ClassLoader</strong> component to locate and execute a bytecode file. </p>
			<p>Let us run the <strong class="source-inline">CompoundInterest01</strong> program. In the console, enter <strong class="source-inline">java CompountInterest01</strong>. There’s no need to include the <strong class="source-inline">.class</strong> extension as that<a id="_idIndexMarker120"/> is <a id="_idIndexMarker121"/>the <a id="_idIndexMarker122"/>only<a id="_idIndexMarker123"/> <span class="No-Break">acceptable extension:</span></p>

			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 2.8 – Running the Java program</p>
			<p>Here, you<a id="_idIndexMarker124"/> can see the program’s output. </p>
			<p>On Windows systems, there is a second JVM loader called javaw that is used to execute a GUI application without opening a console. If you create a Windows shortcut to run a GUI Java program and use <strong class="source-inline">java.exe</strong>, then a console window will open, followed by the program’s GUI window. If you use <strong class="source-inline">javaw.exe</strong>, the console window will <span class="No-Break">not appear.</span></p>
			<p>In most situations, using javac and then java is the most common way to work with Java code at the command line. A program that may consist of multiple files will require each file to be <a id="_idIndexMarker125"/>compiled, but <a id="_idIndexMarker126"/>only the file that contains the <strong class="source-inline">main</strong> method<a id="_idIndexMarker127"/> is<a id="_idIndexMarker128"/> executed. Let us look at one last way to compile and exe<a id="_idTextAnchor049"/>cute a Java program in a <span class="No-Break">single step.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-42"><a id="_idTextAnchor050"/>Launch Single-File Source-Code Programs</h1>
			<p>Before Java 11, the <a id="_idIndexMarker129"/>process of going from source code to execution was a two-step process: you compiled the code and then ran the code. Beginning with Java 11, another way to run a Java program was introduced, called <strong class="bold">Launch Single-File Source-Code Programs</strong>. This allows you to compile, start up the JVM, and execute the program in a single line. We’ll see how this works for Windows, macOS, and Linux before examining a unique way for Linux <span class="No-Break">and macOS.</span></p>

			<ol>
				<li value="1">Add <strong class="source-inline">#!</strong> to the source code, as <span class="No-Break">shown here:</span></li>
			</ol>
			<pre class="source-code">
#!//home/omniprof/jdk-17.0.3+7/bin/java --source 17
import java.text.NumberFormat;
public class CompoundInterest03 {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        var banker = new CompoundInterestCalculator03();
        banker.perform();
    }
}</pre>
			<p>The first line that begins with the Shebang includes the path to the Java executable and the <strong class="source-inline">–source version</strong> switch. The version is the numbered version of Java you are using, which in this case is <strong class="source-inline">17</strong>. To use this technique, the file must not have the <strong class="source-inline">.java</strong> extension. Rename the Java source code file to remove <span class="No-Break">the extension.</span></p>
			<ol>
				<li value="2">The<a id="_idIndexMarker157"/> next <a id="_idIndexMarker158"/>step is to make the file executable. Use <strong class="source-inline">chmod +x CompoundInterest03</strong> to <span class="No-Break">do so.</span></li>
				<li>Finally, you must execute the file by entering <strong class="source-inline">./CompoundInterest03</strong>. Here is <span class="No-Break">the output:</span></li>

			<p>Here, we are running our Java program as if it were just a regular Linux or <span class="No-Break">macOS program.</span></p>
			<p>This concludes our topic on using Java from the command line. We started by looking at REPL in JShell, then the classic two-step approach, and ended with the Launch Single-File Source-Code Programs approach. We also covered the unique Shebang technique. Now, let us learn about the four most widely used IDEs. </p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-45"><a id="_idTextAnchor053"/>Integrated development environments</h1>
			<p>It is time for a<a id="_idIndexMarker159"/> little honesty – very few Java developers work with just a text editor such as <strong class="bold">vi</strong> or <strong class="bold">Notepad</strong>. Knowing<a id="_idIndexMarker160"/> how to <a id="_idIndexMarker161"/>work with a standalone text editor and compile/execute at the command line is an important skill, but when given the choice of tooling, we will always go for an IDE. The features we will look at in this section will explain why this <span class="No-Break">is so.</span></p>
			<p>In this section, we will briefly review four of the most widely used IDEs available. Each IDE has a unique build system, which we will discuss in <a href="B19088_03.xhtml#_idTextAnchor062"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 3</em></span></a>, <em class="italic">The Maven Build Tool</em>, and all the IDEs support the same external build systems. This means that in a team, each member can use the IDE that they feel makes them the most productive while being able to freely move code between team members without the need to make changes for a particular IDE. Before I introduce these IDEs, let us look at the features they <span class="No-Break">all share.</span></p>
			<h3>Feature 1 – the code editor</h3>
			<p>The heart of<a id="_idIndexMarker162"/> every IDE is its editor. Like any ordinary text editor, it supports the usual list of features, such as cut, copy, and paste. What sets the IDE editor apart from these is that every keystroke is monitored. Should you mistype the name of a variable or method, you will immediately be informed on your screen of the error. </p>
			<p>The editors also share JShell’s ability to execute code one line at a time. This occurs out of sight. If you are executing code that generates an error – such as referring to a library that is not part of the project – you will be told of the error in the editor as you type rather than when you try to compile and execute the code. Most errors in your code, though not all, are detected as <span class="No-Break">you type.</span></p>
			<p>Another invaluable feature of these editors is<a id="_idIndexMarker163"/> called <strong class="bold">code completion</strong>. Microsoft calls this<a id="_idIndexMarker164"/> feature <strong class="bold">IntelliSense</strong>. Code completion can mean several things – for example, if you write an opening brace, bracket, or parenthesis, the IDE will add the closing one. </p>
			<p>In Java, like some other OOP languages, the dot operator (<strong class="source-inline">.</strong>) indicates that you wish to call upon a member method or instance variable of an object. Code completion supports listing all the possible choices after the dot operator. The following figure shows all the choices <span class="No-Break">for </span><span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">percentFormat</strong></span><span class="No-Break">:</span></p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer022" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure_2.12_B19088.jpg" alt="Figure 2.12 – Example of code completion in NetBeans"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 2.12 – Example of code completion in NetBeans</p>
			<p>Code completion can also recommend changes in your code that are more efficient or modern. For example, the<a id="_idIndexMarker165"/> original Java <strong class="bold">switch</strong> statement is identical to the C switch. Recent <a id="_idIndexMarker166"/>enhancements to the switch syntax can effectively eliminate the ancient switch. If the IDE recognizes that the modern syntax could be used, then you will be advised and, with your permission, the IDE will rewrite your switch in the new format. </p>
			<h3>Feature 2 – server management</h3>
			<p><strong class="bold">Servers</strong> represent<a id="_idIndexMarker167"/> external <a id="_idIndexMarker168"/>services that your code may need to interact with. Examples include database servers <a id="_idIndexMarker169"/>such<a id="_idIndexMarker170"/> as <strong class="bold">MySQL</strong> and <strong class="bold">PostgreSQL</strong> and web <a id="_idIndexMarker171"/>servers<a id="_idIndexMarker172"/> such as <strong class="bold">Payara</strong> and <strong class="bold">WildFly</strong>. From within the IDE, it is possible to stop and start these services. For database servers, you can connect the IDE to the server and<a id="_idIndexMarker173"/> write <strong class="bold">SQL</strong> queries and see the results. Applications or web servers can also be started and stopped. You can deploy or undeploy your compiled code to <span class="No-Break">the server.</span></p>
			<h3>Feature 3 – debugging and profiling</h3>
			<p>Single-stepping <a id="_idIndexMarker174"/>through code is an<a id="_idIndexMarker175"/> invaluable feature of debugging tools. Modern IDEs provide such debugging capabilities; it is invaluable when your code runs but returns the wrong result. When running with a debugger, you can follow the execution of your program in the source code. You can inspect the state of the variables. Errors in the syntax of your coding are mostly recognized by the editor. </p>
			<p>Profiling allows you to monitor your application while it runs. The profiler reports memory usage and the CPU time that a method consumes. This can be invaluable information in identifying where a program executes more slowly than you expected. Even if you did not suspect a problem with program speed, a profiler can provide you with the data you need to improve the performance of <span class="No-Break">your program.</span></p>
			<h3>Feature 4 –  source control management</h3>
			<p>Modern IDEs<a id="_idIndexMarker176"/> support interaction with source <a id="_idIndexMarker177"/>control <a id="_idIndexMarker178"/>management tools such<a id="_idIndexMarker179"/> as <strong class="bold">Git</strong>, <strong class="bold">Mercurial</strong>, and <strong class="bold">Subversion</strong>. These tools maintain your code in a repository. There is no need to use a standalone client tool to push or pull from a repository. Should a push result in a conflict, then the IDE can present what is currently in the repository and what you want to push and allow you to decide how to resolve <span class="No-Break">the conflict.</span></p>
			<h3>Feature 5 – build systems</h3>
			<p>The only code <a id="_idIndexMarker180"/>we have seen so far has consisted of a single file. As we learn more about Java, we will discover that applications typically consist of multiple files. These files may be placed in multiple folders. Then, there are external libraries that provide capabilities that are not part of Java, such as the code necessary to interact with specific databases. A build system is responsible for ensuring that all the components and libraries are available. It is also responsible for running the Java compiler and then running the program. </p>
			<p>All IDEs each have their own build system. The external build systems known as Apache Maven and Gradle, which are independent of an IDE, will be covered in the next chapter. The four IDEs we will cover in this chapter all support these external build systems. This means that if you write a program with IntelliJ that’s been configured to use Maven, then the same files can be opened in NetBeans if it’s been configured to <span class="No-Break">use Maven.</span></p>
			<p>Now, let us take a brief look at the four most widely used IDEs. </p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-46"><a id="_idTextAnchor054"/>Eclipse Foundation – Eclipse</h2>
			<p>The Eclipse IDE<a id="_idIndexMarker181"/> was originally<a id="_idIndexMarker182"/> developed by IBM as a replacement for their existing Java IDE called VisualAge, which was written in Smalltalk. In 2001, IBM released the Eclipse platform, written in Java and released as an open source project. A board made up of companies working with Java was formed to oversee the development of Eclipse. As more and more companies joined the board, it was decided to create an independent open source organization. In 2004, the Eclipse Foundation was created, with the Eclipse IDE as its first open source project. Eclipse can run on Windows, macOS, <span class="No-Break">and Linux.</span></p>
			<p>You can download Eclipse from <a href="https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/">https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/</a>. There is the Eclipse IDE for Java developers for primarily desktop software development. A second version called the Eclipse IDE for enterprise Java and web developers adds support for server-side programming. Eclipse supports a range of plugins that add <span class="No-Break">additional capabilities.</span></p>
			<p>Let us see what the compound interest program – the one we wrote in <em class="italic">The first program</em> section – looks like in the Eclipse IDE: </p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer023" class="IMG---Figure">

				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 2.13 – The compound interest program in Eclipse</p>
			<p>Here, you can <a id="_idIndexMarker183"/>see the output and what<a id="_idIndexMarker184"/> it looks like when you compile and execute it at the command line. All the IDEs capture the console output and display it in a window in <span class="No-Break">the IDE.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-47"><a id="_idTextAnchor055"/>Apache NetBeans</h2>
			<p><strong class="bold">NetBeans</strong> began <a id="_idIndexMarker185"/>as a student <a id="_idIndexMarker186"/>project <a id="_idIndexMarker187"/>in 1996 in the Czech Republic. When James Gosling first encountered NetBeans while he was traveling to promote Java, he was so impressed by it that upon his return, he convinced the management at Sun Microsystems to buy the company behind NetBeans. In 2010, Oracle acquired Sun Microsystems, and in 2016, Oracle donated the NetBeans source code to<a id="_idIndexMarker188"/> the <strong class="bold">Apache Foundation</strong>. NetBeans runs on Windows, macOS, <span class="No-Break">and Linux.</span></p>
			<p>NetBeans has adopted an update cadence like Java, with new versions expected every 6 months. While not as feature-rich as some other IDEs, it is the simplest of the four to work with. As such, it is the ideal candidate when teaching Java or when you wish to use an IDE without a steep learning curve. As an Apache open source project, it is also the easiest to become involved with and <span class="No-Break">contribute to.</span></p>
			<p>You can download Apache NetBeans from <a href="https://netbeans.apache.org/">https://netbeans.apache.org/</a>. There is just one version and it supports desktop and server-side development. In addition, some plugins add additional functionality, such as support for frameworks such <span class="No-Break">as Spring.</span></p>
			<p>Let us see what the compound interest program – the one we wrote in <em class="italic">The first program</em> section – looks <a id="_idIndexMarker189"/>like in<a id="_idIndexMarker190"/> Apac<a id="_idTextAnchor056"/>he NetBeans: </p>

			<p>Here, you can see how NetBeans shows the output of the compound interest program. </p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-48"><a id="_idTextAnchor057"/>Microsoft Visual Studio Code</h2>
			<p><strong class="bold">Visual Studio Code</strong> (<strong class="bold">VS Code</strong>) was <a id="_idIndexMarker191"/>introduced<a id="_idIndexMarker192"/> by <strong class="bold">Microsoft</strong> in 2016. Its <a id="_idIndexMarker193"/>purpose was to be a development environment for a wide range of languages such as JavaScript, C++, Python, and Java, among others. The program consists of a core component that is released as open source. Support for specific languages is handled by extensions. The primary Java extension was developed by Red Hat, and unlike Microsoft-authored extensions, this one is <span class="No-Break">open source.</span></p>
			<p>VS Code is written <a id="_idIndexMarker194"/>in <strong class="bold">TypeScript</strong> and uses the open source Electron framework for creating desktop applications. VS Code is available for Windows, macOS, and Linux, though not all extensions work on <span class="No-Break">every OS.</span></p>
			<p>You can download VS Code along with several Java extensions from <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/java">https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/java</a>. You will want to download the Coding Pack for Java, which contains VS Code plus the Java extensions. If you have already downloaded the basic version of VS Code, you can add Java support to an existing<a id="_idIndexMarker195"/> installation by downloading the Java <span class="No-Break">Extension Pack.</span></p>
			<p>Here’s what the compound interest program – the one we wrote in <em class="italic">The first program</em> section – looks like in VS Code: </p>
			<div>

			<p>Here, you can <a id="_idIndexMarker196"/>see how VS Code shows the output of the compound interest program. </p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-49"><a id="_idTextAnchor058"/>JetBrains IntelliJ IDEA</h2>
			<p><strong class="bold">IntelliJ IDEA</strong> from the <a id="_idIndexMarker197"/>JetBrains <a id="_idIndexMarker198"/>company, written <a id="_idIndexMarker199"/>in Java, was introduced in 2001. It comes in two flavors. First, there is a free Community edition with an open source license for developing desktop Java applications. A second commercial version, called Ultimate, includes support for additional Java frameworks such as Java EE/Jakarta EE and Spring. The commercial version requires an annual <span class="No-Break">paid subscription.</span></p>
			<p>IntelliJ is considered the most feature-rich of the Java IDEs. This does not necessarily mean it is the best, but it is the most widely used of all the IDEs. You can download it from <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/">https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/</a>. As already mentioned, the Community edition is free, while the Ultimate version requires <span class="No-Break">a subscription.</span></p>
			<p>Let us see what the compound interest program – the one we wrote in <em class="italic">The first program</em> section – looks like in IntelliJ IDEA: </p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer026" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure_2.16_B19088.jpg" alt="Figure 2.16 – The compound interest program in IntelliJ IDEA"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 2.16 – The compound interest program in IntelliJ IDEA</p>
			<p>Here, you can <a id="_idIndexMarker200"/>see the output in <a id="_idIndexMarker201"/>IntelliJ IDEA. This is what it looks like when you compile and execute at the command line. </p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-50"><a id="_idTextAnchor059"/>Which IDE should you use?</h2>
			<p>There are two<a id="_idIndexMarker202"/> factors to consider when choosing an IDE: </p>
			<ul>
				<li>The first is whether the company you work for mandates a specific IDE. If so, then the choice has been made for you. </li>
				<li>The second is how you feel when using the IDE. All four of the IDEs shown here can support whatever you are coding in Java. They can also be used for other languages, such as C, C++, PHP, and JavaScript. </li>
			</ul>
			<p>I can only explain what my choice was and the reasons for that choice. I needed an IDE that required the minimum amount of classroom instruction. I taught Java project courses in the final year of a 3-year computer science program at a college in Quebec. I needed to teach advanced desktop programming and introduce the students to server-side programming. I did not want to teach an IDE. For these reasons, I chose NetBeans. Students were permitted to use any of the other three IDEs if they used the external Maven build system, but if they ran into trouble with the IDE, I could only provide minimal assistance. </p>
			<p>So, I recommend that you take the time to experiment with each of the IDEs. Select your personal IDE based on how you feel about using it. They are all effectively the same while presenting unique methods to get things done. All of this book’s source code, which can be found in this book’s GitHub repository, will run on all four IDEs mentioned here. </p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-51"><a id="_idTextAnchor060"/>Summary</h1>
			<p>In this chapter, we examined the various ways in which we can write, compile, and execute Java programs from the command line. We looked at REPL in JShell to run snippets of code quickly. Then, we saw the classic way that Java is compiled and executed in two steps. Finally, we looked at Launch Single-File Source-Code Programs for executing Java programs written in a single file. With the Shebang concept found in macOS and Linux, we saw how Java could even be used as a scripting language. We ended by briefly looking at the four most <span class="No-Break">common IDEs.</span></p>
			<p>Now that you know how to write, compile, and execute Java programs, in the next chapter, we will explore an external build system that can be used from the command line or within an IDE. This topic will help explain why your choice of IDE is personal. You will see why developers can work together while members of the team may use a <span class="No-Break">different IDE.</span></p>
