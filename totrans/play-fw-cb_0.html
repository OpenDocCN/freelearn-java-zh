<p id="e-Y1jW">Web applications have come a long way in the last 5-10 years. From the glory days of Geocities and Friendster, the advent of massively popular websites, in the case of social media sites, such as Facebook, and Twitter, and the more utilitarian web applications that are Software as a service (SAAS) offerings such as SalesForce and Github, there is no denying that with all these advancements in consumer and enterprise web software, there arises a need for a solid web technology platform to build on top of, not only for end-user web clients but also with a variety of sophisticated and complex backend services, all of which can compose the modern web application.</p>
<p id="e-z4qM">This is where Play Framework 2.0 comes in to the scene. Play provides developers with a powerful and mature web development platform that is lightweight and stateless by nature, which was made with development speed and web application scalability in mind.</p>
<p id="e-PfiL">This book aims to give readers a deeper understanding of different parts of Play Framework through concise code recipes based on very common use cases and scenarios. You will be guided through the basic concepts and abstractions used in Play, and we will dive into more advanced and relevant topics such as creating RESTful APIs, using a third-party cloud storage service to store uploaded images, posting messages to external message queues, and deploying Play web applications using Docker.</p>
<p id="e-aJG2">By providing relevant recipes, this book hopes to equip developers with the necessary building blocks required for creating the next Facebook or SalesForce using Play Framework.</p>
<h1 id="e-MhuQ">What this book covers</h1>
<p id="e-ZTHR">Chapter 1, <em>Basics of Play Framework</em>, introduces Play Framework and its capabilities. This chapter also introduces the essential Play components, such as the Controller and View templates. Finally, we cover how to do unit testing for a Play Framework model and controller classes.</p>
<p id="e-y0yb">Chapter 2, <em>Using Controllers</em>, discusses Play Controllers in depth. This chapter demonstrates how to use controllers with other web components such as request filters, sessions, and JSON. It also touches on how Play and Akka can be utilized together from a controller.</p>
<p id="e-jrCl">Chapter 3, <em>Leveraging Modules</em>, looks into utilizing official Play 2 modules as well as other third-party modules. This should help developers speed up their development by reusing and integrating existing modules.</p>
<p id="e-OdBN">Chapter 4, <em>Creating and Using Web APIs</em>, discusses how to create secure RESTful API endpoints with Play. This chapter also discusses how to consume other web-based APIs using the Play WS library.</p>
<p id="e-CsJp">Chapter 5, <em>Creating Plugins and Modules</em>, discusses how to write Play Modules and Plugins, and also tells us how to publish Play modules to a private repository on Amazon S3.</p>
<p id="e-ZN9R">Chapter 6, <em>Practical Module Examples</em>, adds to the previous chapter regarding Play Modules and discusses more practical examples of integrating modules such as message queues and Search Services.</p>
<p id="e-fdaa">Chapter 7, <em>Deploying Play 2 Web Apps</em>, discusses deployment scenarios for different environments for Play web applications using tools such as Docker and Dokku.</p>
<p id="e-xUlq">Chapter 8, <em>Additional Play Information</em>, discusses topics relevant to developers such as integrating with IDEs and using other third-party Cloud services. This chapter also discusses how to build a Play developer environment from scratch using Vagrant.</p>

<p id="e-ZXBk">A block of code is set as follows:</p>
<pre id="e-Vb3f">// Java
    return Promise.wrap(ask(fileReaderActor, words, 3000)).map(
      new Function&amp;lt;Object, Result&amp;gt;() {
