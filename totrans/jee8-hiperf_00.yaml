- en: Java has been a mainstream technology for backend development for many years.
    Part of the reason behind this is its high stability in terms of APIs, hard backward-compatibility
    rules, offering a very stable and reliable backbone for any professional software,
    and its good performance.

- en: The Java EE platform gives developers a flexible and powerful API that allows
    them to concentrate on the features more than on the technical challenges already
    solved by the platform. However, it doesn't mean that you should use it blindly
    and forget all about the work the container does for you; it would lead to a poorly
    behaving and unresponsive application.

- en: When it comes to performance, Java EE is well-designed to let you get metrics,
    instrument your application, find any potential bottlenecks, enhance your application's
    performance to reach your expected Service Level Agreements (SLAs), and satisfy
    your customers and end users.

- en: However, performance is often thought of as something we look at once the application
    is completely developed. This can be true for standalone applications, which are
    easy to optimize as they are self-contained. However, with the advent of microservices
    and distributed applications, you need to think of performance as a continuous
    process in order to avoid having to redevelop your application afterwards.

- en: That is all this book is about—giving you the needed tools to be able to work
    on the performance of your Java EE application, ensure you benefit from the simplicity
    of the Java EE API without abusing of them and having bad surprises, ensure you
    think upfront of the whole application flow and not only on a subpart of the full
    system which can lead to local optimizations and global tragedies and finally,
    ensure you can continuously control your performances and thus work smoothly on
    them during all the development phase and succeed to deliver a high quality product.

    especially people working on performance topics in local or distributed environments
    and production or development environments.

- en: This book assumes that you are, at least, familiar with Java 8 development and
    some Java EE concepts. You don't need to be a Java EE guru, but a basic understanding
    of things such as Java proxying and interception will help you get up to speed
    with the concepts covered in the book.

- en: '[Chapter 1](f8931396-0636-41a9-8bf7-2b67bb424b76.xhtml), *Money – The Quote
    Manager Application*, starts by explaining how to set up a basic environment to
    be able to follow the book''s chapters. It also shows you how to develop a common
    Java EE 8 application, which you can use all along the chapters to easily test
    every topic.'

- en: '[Chapter 2](f9d9ccb7-8c28-4f87-9642-8c62a05fa856.xhtml), *Looking Under the
    Cover – What is This EE Thing?*, explains why we use a JavaEE 8 container and
    what it brings to the developers. It goes through some mainstream technologies,
    and shows the work done under the cover by the server and how it can impact the
    performance when not used the way it was designed to be.'

    targets the instrumentation of the application in several flavors. The high-level
    goal is to get the metrics of your application at every level and layer to ensure
    that you can clearly identify bottlenecks work on the performance of your application.
    It uses several techniques, more or less simple, and targets the different phases
    of work you can do on your application.'

    – Memory Management and Server Configuration*, targets the configuration you can
    use to optimize your application without modifying your code at all. It concentrates
    around JVM memory tuning, which can be very advanced with modern platforms, and
    Java EE server configuration, which can be worth having a look at.'

- en: '[Chapter 5](cdbfd25b-1b43-4b9d-b45c-78586b39ebb5.xhtml), *Scale Up – Threading
    and Implications*, concentrates on the threading model that Java EE 8 offers.
    It starts by listing the thread pool you will work with, how you can define new
    thread pools specific to your application and integrating with the platform, and,
    finally, it opens the end of the chapter, talking about modern programming models
    in the Java EE 8 platform, which completely changes the way you use threads to
    be more reactive.'

- en: '[Chapter 6](8db12a5f-dba9-449b-af38-4963ac0adec0.xhtml), *Be Lazy; Cache Your
    Data*, deals with the caching. It starts by explaining what caching is and how
    it is supposed to help you improve performance. Then, it explains how Java EE
    8 helps you to rely on the cache at HTTP level and how it integrates with JCache
    specification to speed up your code drastically.'

    helps you design and code distributed applications such as microservices to keep
    your performance under control and your application stable. The overall goal is
    to ensure that you don''t get affected by services you rely on in a bad manner
    and that your service stays available irrespective of the state others are in.
    In other words, it helps you prevent a domino effect on your system if something
    goes wrong somewhere.'

    – A Trade-Off*, deals with loggers. This is surely the most common API used across
    all applications, but it can also viciously affect the performance, since a badly
    used or configured logger can be very significant to your performance figures.
    This chapter explains what a logging framework is and how to use it. It will help
    you avoid all these pitfalls.'

    It explains which tools to use, what steps to go through so as to ensure your
    benchmark is useful, and how to get the most out of a benchmark.'

    Evaluation*, goes through several solutions to make sure that you can evaluate
    the performance of your system in a continuous way. It aims to ensure you can
    get performance figures out of your system at each and every development stage
    and, used at the extreme, you can even get it for each pull request done on your
    project. This chapter goes through some tools and solutions, and explains how
    to enrich some existing frameworks with some glue code to go further and not stay
    blocked on the topic that is not yet that common but very important for applications
    with a defined SLA.'
