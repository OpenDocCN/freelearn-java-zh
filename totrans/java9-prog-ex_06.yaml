    have achieved already and create a web version of the Mastermind game. This time,
    it will not only run alone, guessing and answering the number of positions and
    matched colors, but also communicate with the user asking for the answers to the
    guesses. This will be a real game. Web programming is extremely important for
    Java programmers. Most of the programs are web applications. The universal client
    available on the Internet is the web browser. The thin-client, web browser-based
    architecture is widely accepted in enterprises as well. There are only some exceptions
    when the architecture has something else but the web client. If you want to become
    a professional Java developer, you must be familiar with web programming. And
    it is also fun!

    the concrete and end up at the end of the phase with what you seemingly had before:
    flat ground. Except that there is the base. Building without this base, the house
    would either collapse soon after or during the process of building. Networking
    is just as important for web programming. There are a lot of topics that seemingly
    have nothing to do with programming. Still, it is the base of the building and
    when you program web applications, you will also find the fun part in it.'

- en: The network delivers data packets between any two computers connected to it.
    The protocol used on the network is IP, which is simply an abbreviation of Internet
    Protocol. Using IP, a computer can send a data packet to another. The package
    contains a header and the data content. The header contains the Internet addresses
    of the sender and the target machine, other flags, and information about the package.
    Since the machines are not connected to each other directly, routers forward the
    packets. It is like post offices sending mails to each other till it gets into
    the hands of the postman you know, who can directly deliver it to your mailbox.
    To do that, the routers use the information in the header. The algorithm and organization
    of how the routers interact are complex and something we need not know to be Java
    professionals.

    packet; sending it and changing the modulated voltage on the network card or emitting
    photons to the fiber is not your headache. However, you will all know whether

    The major difference that may concern a Java developer is that version 4 uses
    32-bit addresses and version 6 uses 128-bit addresses. When you see a version-4
    address, you will see something like `192.168.1.110`, which contains the four
    bytes in a decimal format separated by dots. IPv6 addresses are expressed as `2001:db8:0:0:0:0:2:1`,
    as eight 16-bit numbers expressed in hexadecimal separated by colons.

    is like sending a one-page letter, then a web page download is like discussing
    a contract in paper mail. There should be an agreement in the initial paper mail
    as to what to send, what to answer, and so on, until the contract is signed. On
    the Internet, that protocol is called **Transmission Control Protocol** (**TCP**).
    While it is highly unlikely (but possible) that you will meet IP routing issues,
    being a Java developer, you certainly may meet TCP programming. Therefore, we
    will cover shortly how the TCP works. Be aware that this is very brief. Really.

    level of interface than IP. When you program TCP, you do not deal with datagrams.
    Instead, you have a channel of byte streams where you can put bytes to be delivered
    to the other computer, and you can read bytes from the channel that were sent
    by the other computer, exactly in the order as they were sent. This is a kind
    of connection between two computers and, what's more, between two programs.

    One of them is **User Datagram Protocol** (**UDP**), used for services when there
    is no need for connections, when the data may be lost and it is more important
    that the data gets to the destination in a timely manner than losing some of the
    packets (video streaming, telephony). When the data amount is small and in case
    it is not delivered, it can be requested again; the cost of losing it is cheap
    (DNS request, see the next section).

- en: When a packet is lost on the network, or when it is sent twice, or when it is
    delivered sooner than a later package, it is handled by the TCP software layer
    implemented by the operating system. This layer is also popularly called the **TCP
    stack**.
  id: totrans-18

- en: 'Since the TCP is a connected protocol, there is a need for something that tells
    the TCP stack which stream a datagram belongs to when it arrives. The stream is
    identified by two ports. A port is a 16-bit integer. One identifies the program
    that initiates the connection, called the source port. The other one identifies
    the target program: the destination port. These are contained in each and every
    TCP packet delivered. When a machine runs a **Secure Shell** (**SSH**) server
    and a web server, they use different ports, usually port 22 and 80\. When a package
    comes that contains the destination port number 22 in the TCP header, the TCP
    stack knows that the data in the packet belongs to the stream handled by the SSH
    server. Likewise, if the destination port is 80, then the data goes to the web
    server.'

    there is no way the clients will find the server program. Web servers are usually

    usually not important and not specified; it is allocated by the TCP stack automatically.

    up a TCP connection.'
  id: totrans-21

- en: To have a connection, the TCP stack has to send a datagram to the destination
    to know that it exists. If there is no server listening on the port, sending the
    data over the network has no result, except for wasting the network bandwidth.
    For this reason, the client first sends an empty data packet called SYN. When
    the other side receives it, it sends back a similar package called SYN-ACK. Finally,
    the client sends a package called ACK. If the packets go through the Atlantic,
    this is approximately 45ms for each package, which is equivalent to 45 million
    seconds in bureaucrat time. This is almost one and a half years. We need three
    of those to set up the connection, and there is more.

  zh: 为了建立连接，TCP堆栈必须向目的地发送一个数据报以确认其存在。如果没有服务器在端口上监听，通过网络发送数据将没有任何结果，除了浪费网络带宽。因此，客户端首先发送一个名为SYN的空数据包。当另一端收到它时，它会发送一个类似的包，称为SYN-ACK。最后，客户端发送一个名为ACK的包。如果数据包穿越大西洋，每个包大约需要45ms，这在官僚时间中相当于4500万秒。这几乎是1年半的时间。我们需要三个这样的数据包来建立连接，而且还有更多。
- en: 'When a TCP connection starts, the client does not start to send the data without
    control. It sends some data packets and then it waits for the server to acknowledge
    their receipt. It would not only be useless, but also network wasting, to send
    data that the server is not prepared to accept and has to throw away. The TCP
    is designed to optimize the network usage. Therefore, the client sends some data,
    and then it waits for the acknowledgement. The TCP stack automatically manages
    this. If the acknowledgement arrives, it sends more packets, and if a carefully
    designed optimization algorithm, implemented in the TCP stack, believes that it
    is good to send more, it will send a bit more data than in the first step. If
    there are negative acknowledgements telling the client that the server could not
    accept some of the data and had to throw it away, then the client will lower the
    number of packets it sends without acknowledgement. But first it starts slow and
    cautious. This is called TCP slow start and we have to be aware of it. Although
    it is a low level networking feature it has consequences that we have to consider
    in our Java code: we use database connection pools instead of creating a new connection
    to the database each time there is a need for some data; we try to manage to have
    as few connections to web servers as possible using techniques such as *keep-alive*,
    *SPDY* protocol, or *http/2.0* (also replacing SPDY).'

- en: The TCP protocol creates a channel using the IP addresses of machines. When
    you type a URL in the browser, it usually does not contain IP numbers. It contains
    machine names. The name is converted to IP numbers using a distributed database
    called **Domain Name System** (**DNS**). This database is distributed, and when
    a program needs to convert a name to an address, it sends DNS request to one of
    the DNS servers it knows. These servers query each other or tell the client whom
    to ask, until the client knows the IP address assigned to the name. The servers
    and the client also cache the recently requested names, so answering is fast.
    On the other hand, when the IP address of a server changes this name, not all
    clients will immediately see the address assignment over the globe. The DNS lookup
    can be easily programmed, and there are classes and methods in JDK that support
    this, but usually we need not care about that; when we program, it is done automatically
    in web programming.

    in the address line of the browser. When we send using `POST`, the parameters
    are still reachable by the client (after all, the information the client sends
    is generated by the client and, as such, cannot be unavailable), but not that
    easy for a simple security-unaware user to copy-paste the information and send,

    can also be delivered in the same TCP channel even before one request is fully
    served. This requires complex package handling in the protocol, but this is hidden
    from the server application programmer as well as the browser programmer. The

    can a server answer a request that is not even issued? Well, the server anticipates.
    For example, the application sends an HTML page that has references to many small
    pictures and icons. The client downloads the HTML page, builds the DOM structure,
    analyzes it, and realizes that the pictures are needed, and sends the request
    for the pictures. The application programmer knows what pictures are there and
    may code the server to send the pictures even before the browser requests for
    it. Every such response includes a URL that this response is for. When the browser
    wants the resource, it realizes that it is already there and does not issue a
    new request. In `HttpServlet`, the program should access `PushBuilder` via the
    request's new `getPushBuilder` method and use that to push down resources to the
    client.

    using the `Cookie` header field. Each cookie has a name, value, domain, path,
    expiration time, and some other parameters. When a request is sent to a URL that
    matches the domain, the path of a non-expired cookie, the client sends the cookie
    to the server. Cookies are usually stored in small files on the client by the
    browser or in a local database. The actual implementation is the business of the
    browser, and we need not worry about it. It is just the text information that
    is not executed by the client. It is only sent back to the server when some rules
    (mainly domain and path) match. Cookies are created by servers and are sent to
    the client in HTTP responses using the `Set-Cookie` header field. Thus, essentially
    the server tells the client, Hey, here is this cookie, whenever you come to me
    next time, show me this piece of information, so I will know it is you.

    to remember who they are talking to heavily use it. But this is not the only use.
    These days, any application that maintains user sessions uses cookies to chain
    up the HTTP requests that come from the same user. When you log in to an application,
    the username and password you use to identify yourself are sent to the server
    only once, and in subsequent requests, only a special cookie is sent to the server
    used to identify the already logged in user. This use of cookies emphasizes why
    it is important to use cookie values that cannot be easily guessed. If the cookie
    used to identify a user is easily guessable, then an attacker could just create
    a cookie and send it to the server mimicking the other user. Cookie values, for
    the purpose, are usually long random strings.

    should always consider the fact that the cookie travels through the network and
    can go huge as more and more data is encoded in it and can create unnecessary
    burden on the network. Usually, it is better to send only some unique, otherwise
    meaningless, random key, and store the values in some database, be it on disk

    a part of the application logic. Every time something was changed on the user
    interface, the browser started a communication with the server, and in a HTTP
    request-response pair, the browser content was replaced. A web application was
    essentially a series of form filling and form data sending to the server, and
    the server responded with HTML-formatted pages, presumably containing new forms.

    When the code is downloaded from the web server, the JavaScript starts to execute
    and communicate with the server. It is still HTTP requests and responses, but
    the responses do not contain HTML code. It contains pure data, usually in the
    JSON format. This data is used by the JavaScript code and some of the data, if
    needed, is displayed on the web browser display also controlled by JavaScript.
    This is functionally equivalent to a three-tier architecture with some slight
    but very important differences.

    reasons, compared to a program running on the browser. At the same time this is
    a handy limitation because clients aren't and shouldn't be a trusted part of the
    architecture. The disk in the client computer is hard and expensive to back up.
    It can be stolen with a notebook, and encrypting it is costly. There are tools

    the validity of some functionality or data, then the physical security provided
    by the physical control of the server is not used. Whenever data is sent from
    the client to the server, the data has to be checked in regards of validity, no
    matter what the client application is. Actually, since the client application
    can be changed, we just don't really know what the client application really is.

    avoided JavaScript. Therefore, I have to emphasize again that the example is to
    demonstrate the programming of the server side and still providing something that
    really works. A modern application would use REST and JSON communications and
    would not play around creating HTML on the fly on the server side. Originally,
    I wanted to create a JavaScript client and REST server application, but the focus
    was moved so much from server-side Java programming that I dropped this idea.

    big advantage of JSP is that it contains code that runs on the server as well
    as on the client-side code. The developers follow the paradigm many times, so
    do not be surprised to see some legacy code that contains Java, HTML, CSS, and
    JavaScript all mixed in a JSP file. Since Java and JavaScript are syntactically
    similar sometimes, it is not obvious to see what is executed on the server and
    what is executed on the client. I have even seen code that created JavaScript
    code from Java code in a JSP file. That is a total mix of different responsibilities
    and a mess that is nearly impossible to maintain. This led to the total deprecation
    of JSP as of today.

    the design can be decoupled from the structure of the text. If I had to choose

    fully functional, interpreted programming language executed by the browser. It
    can access the DOM tree, and read and modify it. When the DOM tree is modified,
    the browser automatically displays the modified page. JavaScript functions can
    be scheduled and registered to be invoked when some event occurs. For example,
    you can register a function to be invoked when the document is fully loaded, when
    the user presses a button, clicks on a link, or just hovers the mouse over some
    section. Although JavaScript was first only used to create funny animations on
    the browser, today it is possible, and is a usual practice, to program fully functional
    clients using the capabilities of the browser. There are really powerful programs
    written in JavaScript, even such power-hungry applications as PC emulators.

    to the table and sends an HTML page that contains not only the new guess but also
    all the previous guesses and the `full` and `partial` match values that the user
    gave for each of the rows. To send the data to the server, the values are stored
    in the fields of a form. When the form is submitted, the browser gathers the information
    in the fields, creates an encoded string from the content of the fields, and puts
    the content into the body of a `POST` request.

    series of requests belong to one session. To know that the requests belong to
    the same session, the servlet container automatically sends a cookie named `JSESSIONID`
    to the client, and this cookie has a long, random, hard-to-guess value (`tkojxpz9qk9xo7124pvanc1z`
    as I run the application in Jetty). The servlet maintains a session store that
    contains the `HttpSession` instances. The key string that travels in the value
    of the `JSESSIONID` cookie identifies the instances. When an HTTP request arrives
    at the servlet, the container attaches the session to the request object from
    the store. If there is no session for the key, then one is created, and the code
    can access the session object by calling the `request.getSession()` method.
  id: totrans-148

    `getAttribute(String)`, and `removeAttribute(String)` methods to store, retrieve,
    or delete an attribute object. Each attribute is assigned to a `String` and can
    be any `Object`.
  id: totrans-149

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Although the session attribute store essentially looks as simple as a `Map<String,?>`
    object, it is not. The values stored in the session can be moved from one node
    to another when the servlet container runs in a clustered or other distributed
    environment. To do that, the values are serialized; therefore, the values stored
    in the session should be `Serializable`. Failing to do so is a very common novice
    error. During development, executing the code in a simple development Tomcat or
    Jetty container practically never serializes the session to disk and never loads
    it from the serialized form. This means that the values set using `setAttribute`
    will be available by calling `getAttribute`. We run into trouble the first time
    the application gets installed in a clustered environment. As soon as a HTTP request
    arrives on different nodes `getAttribute` may return `null`. The method `setAttribute`
    is called on one node and during the processing of the next request `getAttribute`
    on a different node cannot deserialize the attribute value from the disk shared
    among the nodes. This is usually, and sadly, the production environment.

    an object is a heavy operation that costs several CPU cycles. If the structure
    of the application uses only a part of the client state serving most of the HTTP
    requests, then this is a waste of CPU to create the whole state in memory from
    a serialized form and then serializing it again. In such cases, it is more advisable
    to store only a key in the session and use some database (SQL or NoSQL) or some
    other service to store the actual data referenced by the key. Enterprise applications
    almost exclusively use this structure.

    The implementation in this case is important. The `HashMap` class implements the

    This alone does not guarantee that everything in `HashMap` is `Serializable`.
    The keys and the values in our case are Strings, and fortunately, the `String`
    class also implements the `Serializable` interface. This way, the converted `HashMap`
    object can be safely stored in the session.

    They are just two directions of the same conversion. On the other hand, the implementation
    of the `Table` to `Map` direction should use a `Map` version that is `Serializable`.
    This is very much related to session handling. Converting a `Map` object, in general,
    to a `Table` object is one level higher, restoring the table from wherever it
    was stored: client, session, database, or in the moisture of the cloud. Session

    to record information about the operation of code. This is not the core functionality
    of the application but is inevitable to have a program that can be operated. There
    are messages we print out to the log, which can be used by the operating personnel
    to identify environmental issues. For example, when an `IOException` is thrown
    and it gets logged, the operation may look at the logs and identify that the disk
    got full. They may delete files, or add a new disk and extend the partition. Without
    the logs, the only information would be that the program does not work.

    code are the only source of finding the root cause of some error.
  id: totrans-236

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Since logging needs CPU, IO bandwidth, and other resources, it should be carefully
    examined what and when to log. This examination and the decisions could be done
    during programming, and as a matter of fact, that is the only possibility if we
    used `System.out.println` for logging. If we need to find a bug, we should log
    a lot. If we log a lot, the performance of the system will go down. The conclusion
    is that we have to log only if it is needed. If there is a bug in the system that
    cannot be reproduced, the developers ask the operation to switch on debug logging
    for a short period. Switching on and off different parts of logging is not possible
    when `System.out.println` is used. When the debug level log is switched on, the
    performance may go down for a while, but at the same time, the logs become available
    for analysis. At the same time, the analysis is simpler when we have to find the
    log lines that are relevant (and you do not know beforehand which are relevant)
    if there is a small (a few hundred megabytes log file) rather than a lot of 2-GB
    compressed log files to find the lines in.

    the log objects that we usually use are stored in a `static` field, and since
    they are used as long as the class is used, the program running the field is also
    `final`. For example using the slf4j façade we can get a logger with the following
    command:'

    or returns the one that is already available.

- en: The name of the variable is usually `log` or `logger,` but do not be surprised
    if you see `LOG` or `LOGGER`. The reason for uppercasing the name of the variable
    is that some static code analysis checkers treat `static final` variables as constants,
    as they really are, and the convention in the Java community is to use uppercase
    names for such variables. It is a matter of taste; many times `log` and `logger` are
    used in lowercase.

    literal inside strings. This way, there is no need to append the string from small
    parts, and in case the actual log item is not sent to the log destination, the
    formatting will not perform. If we use `String` concatenation in any form to pass
    a string as an argument, then the formatting will happen even if debug logging
    is not desired as per the example.

    message and `Throwable`. In this case, the logging framework will take care of
    the output of the exception and the stack trace along with it. If you log something
    in exception handling code, log the exception and let the logger format it.'

- en: We discussed the servlet technology, a bit of JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. When
    programming in a real professional environment, these technologies are generally
    used. The creation of the user interface of applications, however, was not always
    based on these technologies. Older operating system-native GUI applications as
    well as Swing, AWT, and SWT use a different approach to create UI. They build
    up the UI facing the user from program code, and the UI is built as a hierarchical
    structure of components. When web programming started, Java developers had experience
    with technologies like these and projects created frameworks that tried to hide
    the web technology layer.

    server as well as the browser code in Java, but since there is no Java environment
    implemented in the browsers, it transpiles (converts) the client part of the code
    from Java to JavaScript. The last release of the toolkit was created two years
    ago in 2014 and since then Google has released other types of web programming
    toolkits that support native JavaScript, HTML, and CSS client development.

    code on the server in Java. It is built on top of GWT and is commercially supported.
    It may be a good choice in case there are developers available who have experience
    with GUI development in Java but not in web native technologies, and the application
    does not require special usability tuning on the client side. A typical intranet
    corporate application can select it as a technology.'

- en: '**Java Server Faces** (**JSF**) is a technology that tries to offload the client-side
    development of the application from the developers providing widgets ready to
    be used and the server side. It is a collection of several **Java Specification
    Requests** (**JSR**) and there are several implementations. The components and
    their relations are configured in XML files and the server creates the client
    native code. In this technology, there is no transpilation from Java to JavaScript.
    It is more like using a limited but huge set of widgets, limiting the use to those
    only, and giving up direct programming of the web browser. If one has the experience
    and knowledge, however, they can create new widgets in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.'

    in Java. The modern approach advocated by most of the big players is to develop
    the server side and the client side using separate toolsets and methodologies, and
    connect the two using REST communication.

    without understanding the basics of TCP/IP networking, which is the protocol of
    the Internet. The application level protocol that is used over that is HTTP, currently
    in a very new version 2.0, which is still not supported by the servlet standard.
    We created a version of the Mastermind game that, this time, can really be played
    using the browser and we started it in a development environment using Jetty.
    We examined how to store the game state and implemented two versions. Finally,
    we learned the basics of logging and we looked at other technologies. At the same
    time, we also looked at the dependency injection implementation Guice from Google,
    and we studied how it works under the hood, and why and how to use it.

    in Java and will understand the architecture of such a program. You will understand
    what is under the hood when you start learning how to program web applications
    using the Spring framework, which hides many of the complexities of web programming.
