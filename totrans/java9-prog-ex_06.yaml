    have achieved already and create a web version of the Mastermind game. This time,
    it will not only run alone, guessing and answering the number of positions and
    matched colors, but also communicate with the user asking for the answers to the
    guesses. This will be a real game. Web programming is extremely important for
    Java programmers. Most of the programs are web applications. The universal client
    available on the Internet is the web browser. The thin-client, web browser-based
    architecture is widely accepted in enterprises as well. There are only some exceptions
    when the architecture has something else but the web client. If you want to become
    a professional Java developer, you must be familiar with web programming. And
    it is also fun!

    base of the whole building. It is not too sexy, just like when you construct the
    building. You spend a lot of money and effort digging trenches, and then you bury
    the concrete and end up at the end of the phase with what you seemingly had before:
    flat ground. Except that there is the base. Building without this base, the house
    would either collapse soon after or during the process of building. Networking
    is just as important for web programming. There are a lot of topics that seemingly
    have nothing to do with programming. Still, it is the base of the building and
    when you program web applications, you will also find the fun part in it.'

    are topics that you can learn from somewhere else as well. In case you are not
    an expert in some of these areas, there are usually other experts in enterprise
    project teams who can extend your knowledge. (In the case of networking, there
    is no mercy.) In addition to that, JavaScript is a topic so complex and huge that
    it deserves a whole book to start with it. There are only very few experts who
    deeply understand both Java and JavaScript. I understand the general structure

    of Mastermind. Note that we hardly ever program servlets directly without the
    aid of some framework that implements the code to handle parameters, authentication,
    and many other things that are not application-specific. We will still stick to
    a naked servlet in this chapter because it is not possible to effectively use

    that is resilient to rocket attack, then it was extended to be an academic network,
    and later it became a commercial network used by anyone and available almost ubiquitously
    all over the Earth.

    of Gagarin over the Earth in the fifties. Sending Gagarin to space and travelling
    over the Earth was a demonstration that Russia could send a rocket anywhere on
    the globe, possibly with atomic explosives. It meant that any data network that
    needed some central control was not resilient to such an attack. It was not feasible
    to have a network with a central location as a single point of failure. Therefore,
    research was started to create a network that goes on working even if any part
    of it is brought down.

- en: The network delivers data packets between any two computers connected to it.
    The protocol used on the network is IP, which is simply an abbreviation of Internet
    Protocol. Using IP, a computer can send a data packet to another. The package
    contains a header and the data content. The header contains the Internet addresses
    of the sender and the target machine, other flags, and information about the package.
    Since the machines are not connected to each other directly, routers forward the
    packets. It is like post offices sending mails to each other till it gets into
    the hands of the postman you know, who can directly deliver it to your mailbox.
    To do that, the routers use the information in the header. The algorithm and organization
    of how the routers interact are complex and something we need not know to be Java
    professionals.

    look at `java.net.DatagramPacket`, and the rest is implemented in the JDK, the
    operating system, and on the firmware of the network card. You can create a data
    packet; sending it and changing the modulated voltage on the network card or emitting
    photons to the fiber is not your headache. However, you will all know whether
    you really need to program datagrams directly.

    that coexists with the old one is IPv6 or IPng (*ng* stands for *new generation*).
    The major difference that may concern a Java developer is that version 4 uses
    32-bit addresses and version 6 uses 128-bit addresses. When you see a version-4
    address, you will see something like `192.168.1.110`, which contains the four
    bytes in a decimal format separated by dots. IPv6 addresses are expressed as `2001:db8:0:0:0:0:2:1`,
    as eight 16-bit numbers expressed in hexadecimal separated by colons.

    is like sending a one-page letter, then a web page download is like discussing
    a contract in paper mail. There should be an agreement in the initial paper mail
    as to what to send, what to answer, and so on, until the contract is signed. On
    the Internet, that protocol is called **Transmission Control Protocol** (**TCP**).
    While it is highly unlikely (but possible) that you will meet IP routing issues,
    being a Java developer, you certainly may meet TCP programming. Therefore, we
    will cover shortly how the TCP works. Be aware that this is very brief. Really.
    You will not become a TCP expert reading the next section, but you will get a
    glimpse of the most important issues that affect web programming.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The TCP protocol is implemented in the operating system and provides a higher
    level of interface than IP. When you program TCP, you do not deal with datagrams.
    Instead, you have a channel of byte streams where you can put bytes to be delivered
    to the other computer, and you can read bytes from the channel that were sent
    by the other computer, exactly in the order as they were sent. This is a kind
    of connection between two computers and, what's more, between two programs.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There are other protocols that are implemented over IP and which are not connection-oriented.
    One of them is **User Datagram Protocol** (**UDP**), used for services when there
    is no need for connections, when the data may be lost and it is more important
    that the data gets to the destination in a timely manner than losing some of the
    packets (video streaming, telephony). When the data amount is small and in case
    it is not delivered, it can be requested again; the cost of losing it is cheap
    (DNS request, see the next section).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When a packet is lost on the network, or when it is sent twice, or when it is
    delivered sooner than a later package, it is handled by the TCP software layer
    implemented by the operating system. This layer is also popularly called the **TCP
    stack**.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'Since the TCP is a connected protocol, there is a need for something that tells
    the TCP stack which stream a datagram belongs to when it arrives. The stream is
    identified by two ports. A port is a 16-bit integer. One identifies the program
    that initiates the connection, called the source port. The other one identifies
    the target program: the destination port. These are contained in each and every
    TCP packet delivered. When a machine runs a **Secure Shell** (**SSH**) server
    and a web server, they use different ports, usually port 22 and 80\. When a package
    comes that contains the destination port number 22 in the TCP header, the TCP
    stack knows that the data in the packet belongs to the stream handled by the SSH
    server. Likewise, if the destination port is 80, then the data goes to the web
    server.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When we program a server, we usually have to define the port number; otherwise,
    there is no way the clients will find the server program. Web servers are usually
    listen on port 80, and clients try to connect to that port. The client port is
    usually not important and not specified; it is allocated by the TCP stack automatically.
  prefs: []

- en: 'To connect from a client code to a server is easy: only a few lines of code.
    Sometimes, it is only one line of code. However, under the hood, there is a lot
    of work that the TCP stack does that we should care about—it takes time to build
    up a TCP connection.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To have a connection, the TCP stack has to send a datagram to the destination
    to know that it exists. If there is no server listening on the port, sending the
    data over the network has no result, except for wasting the network bandwidth.
    For this reason, the client first sends an empty data packet called SYN. When
    the other side receives it, it sends back a similar package called SYN-ACK. Finally,
    the client sends a package called ACK. If the packets go through the Atlantic,
    this is approximately 45ms for each package, which is equivalent to 45 million
    seconds in bureaucrat time. This is almost one and a half years. We need three
    of those to set up the connection, and there is more.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'When a TCP connection starts, the client does not start to send the data without
    control. It sends some data packets and then it waits for the server to acknowledge
    their receipt. It would not only be useless, but also network wasting, to send
    data that the server is not prepared to accept and has to throw away. The TCP
    is designed to optimize the network usage. Therefore, the client sends some data,
    and then it waits for the acknowledgement. The TCP stack automatically manages
    this. If the acknowledgement arrives, it sends more packets, and if a carefully
    designed optimization algorithm, implemented in the TCP stack, believes that it
    is good to send more, it will send a bit more data than in the first step. If
    there are negative acknowledgements telling the client that the server could not
    accept some of the data and had to throw it away, then the client will lower the
    number of packets it sends without acknowledgement. But first it starts slow and
    cautious. This is called TCP slow start and we have to be aware of it. Although
    it is a low level networking feature it has consequences that we have to consider
    in our Java code: we use database connection pools instead of creating a new connection
    to the database each time there is a need for some data; we try to manage to have
    as few connections to web servers as possible using techniques such as *keep-alive*,
    *SPDY* protocol, or *http/2.0* (also replacing SPDY).'

- en: The TCP protocol creates a channel using the IP addresses of machines. When
    you type a URL in the browser, it usually does not contain IP numbers. It contains
    machine names. The name is converted to IP numbers using a distributed database
    called **Domain Name System** (**DNS**). This database is distributed, and when
    a program needs to convert a name to an address, it sends DNS request to one of
    the DNS servers it knows. These servers query each other or tell the client whom
    to ask, until the client knows the IP address assigned to the name. The servers
    and the client also cache the recently requested names, so answering is fast.
    On the other hand, when the IP address of a server changes this name, not all
    clients will immediately see the address assignment over the globe. The DNS lookup
    can be easily programmed, and there are classes and methods in JDK that support
    this, but usually we need not care about that; when we program, it is done automatically
    in web programming.

    In the case of a `GET` request, the body of the request is empty. This is the
    method used by the browser when we download a web page. It is also, many times,
    the method used when some program implemented in JavaScript and running in the
    browser asks for some information from a web application, but it does not want
    to send much information to the server.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When the client uses `POST`, the intention is usually to send some data to the
    server. The server does reply and, many times, there is also a body in the reply,
    but the main purpose of the request/reply communication is to send some information
    from the client to the server. This is the opposite of the `GET` method in some
    sense.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The `GET` and `POST` methods are the most frequently used methods. Although
    there is a general guideline to use `GET` to retrieve data and `POST` to send
    data to the server, it is only a recommendation, and there is no clean separation
    of the two cases. Many times, `GET` is used to send some data to the server. After
    all, it is an HTTP request with a status line and header fields, and although
    there is no body in the request, the object (part of the URL) that follows the
    method in the status line is still able to deliver parameters. Many times, it
    is also easy to test a service that responds to a `GET` request because you only
    need a browser and to type in the URL with the parameters, and look at the response
    in the browser developer tools. You should not be surprised if you see an application
    that uses `GET` requests to execute operations that modify the state on a web
    server. However, not being surprised does not mean approval. You should be aware
    that in most cases, these are not good practices. When we send sensitive information
    using the `GET` request, the parameters in the URL are available to the client
    in the address line of the browser. When we send using `POST`, the parameters
    are still reachable by the client (after all, the information the client sends
    is generated by the client and, as such, cannot be unavailable), but not that
    easy for a simple security-unaware user to copy-paste the information and send,
    perhaps, to a malevolent third party. The decision between using `GET` and `POST`
    should always consider practicalities and security issues.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The `HEAD` method is identical to a `GET` request, but the response will not
    contain a body. This is used when the client is not interested in the actual response.
    It may happen that the client already has the object and wants to see if it was
    changed. The `Last-Modified` header will contain the time when the resource was
    last changed, and the client can decide if it has a newer one or needs to ask
    for the resource in a new request.

    does not help when a response is created slowly. In the new protocol, other resources
    can also be delivered in the same TCP channel even before one request is fully
    served. This requires complex package handling in the protocol, but this is hidden
    from the server application programmer as well as the browser programmer. The
    application server, servlet container, and browser implement this transparently.

    can a server answer a request that is not even issued? Well, the server anticipates.
    For example, the application sends an HTML page that has references to many small
    pictures and icons. The client downloads the HTML page, builds the DOM structure,
    analyzes it, and realizes that the pictures are needed, and sends the request
    for the pictures. The application programmer knows what pictures are there and
    may code the server to send the pictures even before the browser requests for
    it. Every such response includes a URL that this response is for. When the browser
    wants the resource, it realizes that it is already there and does not issue a
    new request. In `HttpServlet`, the program should access `PushBuilder` via the
    request's new `getPushBuilder` method and use that to push down resources to the
    client.

    matches the domain, the path of a non-expired cookie, the client sends the cookie
    to the server. Cookies are usually stored in small files on the client by the
    browser or in a local database. The actual implementation is the business of the
    browser, and we need not worry about it. It is just the text information that
    is not executed by the client. It is only sent back to the server when some rules
    (mainly domain and path) match. Cookies are created by servers and are sent to

    to remember who they are talking to heavily use it. But this is not the only use.
    These days, any application that maintains user sessions uses cookies to chain
    up the HTTP requests that come from the same user. When you log in to an application,
    the username and password you use to identify yourself are sent to the server
    only once, and in subsequent requests, only a special cookie is sent to the server
    used to identify the already logged in user. This use of cookies emphasizes why
    it is important to use cookie values that cannot be easily guessed. If the cookie
    used to identify a user is easily guessable, then an attacker could just create
    a cookie and send it to the server mimicking the other user. Cookie values, for
    the purpose, are usually long random strings.

- en: Cookies are not always sent back to the server where they originate. When the
    cookie is set, the server specifies the domain of the URL where the cookie should
    be sent back. This is used when a different server from the one providing the
    services needing authentication does the user authentication.

- en: Applications sometimes encode values into cookies. This is not necessarily bad,
    though in most actual cases, it is. When encoding something into a cookie, we
    should always consider the fact that the cookie travels through the network and
    can go huge as more and more data is encoded in it and can create unnecessary
    burden on the network. Usually, it is better to send only some unique, otherwise
    meaningless, random key, and store the values in some database, be it on disk
    or in the memory.

    The server part will be written in Java, the browser part will be implemented

    the server part, but we should still be aware of the fact that many of the functionalities
    can be and should be implemented to run in the browser. The two programs communicate

    started to replace the client applications in many use cases. Previously, the
    browser could not run complex JavaScript applications. The application was executed
    on the web server and the client displayed the HTML that the server created as
    a part of the application logic. Every time something was changed on the user
    interface, the browser started a communication with the server, and in a HTTP
    request-response pair, the browser content was replaced. A web application was
    essentially a series of form filling and form data sending to the server, and
    the server responded with HTML-formatted pages, presumably containing new forms.

    standardized. Today, modern web applications contain HTML (which is a part of
    the client code and is not generated by the server on the fly), CSS, and JavaScript.
    When the code is downloaded from the web server, the JavaScript starts to execute
    and communicate with the server. It is still HTTP requests and responses, but
    the responses do not contain HTML code. It contains pure data, usually in the
    JSON format. This data is used by the JavaScript code and some of the data, if
    needed, is displayed on the web browser display also controlled by JavaScript.
    This is functionally equivalent to a three-tier architecture with some slight
    but very important differences.

    the resources of the client machine. Thick client applications could save anything
    in a local file or access a local database. This is very limited, for security
    reasons, compared to a program running on the browser. At the same time this is
    a handy limitation because clients aren't and shouldn't be a trusted part of the
    architecture. The disk in the client computer is hard and expensive to back up.
    It can be stolen with a notebook, and encrypting it is costly. There are tools
    to protect client storage, but most of the time, storing the data on the server
    only is a more viable solution.

    client physically controls the client computer and although it can be made technically
    very difficult, the client can still overcome the security limitations of the
    client device and client code. If it is only the client application that checks
    the validity of some functionality or data, then the physical security provided
    by the physical control of the server is not used. Whenever data is sent from
    the client to the server, the data has to be checked in regards of validity, no
    matter what the client application is. Actually, since the client application
    can be changed, we just don't really know what the client application really is.

    avoided JavaScript. Therefore, I have to emphasize again that the example is to
    demonstrate the programming of the server side and still providing something that
    really works. A modern application would use REST and JSON communications and
    would not play around creating HTML on the fly on the server side. Originally,
    I wanted to create a JavaScript client and REST server application, but the focus
    was moved so much from server-side Java programming that I dropped this idea.

    possibilities. A servlet object may be put into service more than once, and after
    calling `destroy`, the servlet container may invoke `init` again; thus, this cycle

    In case the container runs on the same machine in several processes, each executing
    a JVM, or even on different machines, there can be many servlet instances that
    handle the requests. Generally, the servlet classes should be designed such that

    they should also not assume that the instance is the same for different requests.

    `PrintWriter`, which is to be used to send characters to the body of the HTTP
    response. This is the content that appears in the browser. The mime type we send
    is `text/html`, and this is set by calling the `setContentType` method. This will

    to add old guesses to rebuild the table.

    first one. Later on, when the user tells the program the full and partial matches,
    the program needs the `Game` structure with `Table` and `Row` objects containing
    `Guess` objects and the `full` and `partial` match values. These were already
    available, but when the new HTTP hit comes in, we have to pull it from somewhere.
    Programming a servlet, we have to store the state of the game somewhere and restore
    it when a new HTTP request hits the server.

- en: Storing the state can be done in two places. One place, which we will first
    do in our code, is the client. When the program creates a new guess, it adds it
    to the table and sends an HTML page that contains not only the new guess but also
    all the previous guesses and the `full` and `partial` match values that the user
    gave for each of the rows. To send the data to the server, the values are stored
    in the fields of a form. When the form is submitted, the browser gathers the information
    in the fields, creates an encoded string from the content of the fields, and puts
    the content into the body of a `POST` request.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The other possibility for storing the actual state is in the server. The server
    can store the state of the game, and it can reconstruct the structure when it
    creates a new guess. The problem in this case is knowing which game to use. The
    server can and should store many games, one for each user, and users may use the
    application concurrently. It does not necessarily mean strong concurrency in the
    same meaning as we examined in the previous chapter.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When a client sends requests from the same browser to the same servlet, the
    series of requests belong to one session. To know that the requests belong to
    the same session, the servlet container automatically sends a cookie named `JSESSIONID`
    to the client, and this cookie has a long, random, hard-to-guess value (`tkojxpz9qk9xo7124pvanc1z`
    as I run the application in Jetty). The servlet maintains a session store that
    contains the `HttpSession` instances. The key string that travels in the value
    of the `JSESSIONID` cookie identifies the instances. When an HTTP request arrives
    at the servlet, the container attaches the session to the request object from
    the store. If there is no session for the key, then one is created, and the code
    can access the session object by calling the `request.getSession()` method.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A `HttpSession` object can store attributes. The program can call the `setAttribute(String,Object)`,
    `getAttribute(String)`, and `removeAttribute(String)` methods to store, retrieve,
    or delete an attribute object. Each attribute is assigned to a `String` and can
    be any `Object`.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Although the session attribute store essentially looks as simple as a `Map<String,?>`
    object, it is not. The values stored in the session can be moved from one node
    to another when the servlet container runs in a clustered or other distributed
    environment. To do that, the values are serialized; therefore, the values stored
    in the session should be `Serializable`. Failing to do so is a very common novice
    error. During development, executing the code in a simple development Tomcat or
    Jetty container practically never serializes the session to disk and never loads
    it from the serialized form. This means that the values set using `setAttribute`
    will be available by calling `getAttribute`. We run into trouble the first time
    the application gets installed in a clustered environment. As soon as a HTTP request
    arrives on different nodes `getAttribute` may return `null`. The method `setAttribute`
    is called on one node and during the processing of the next request `getAttribute`
    on a different node cannot deserialize the attribute value from the disk shared
    among the nodes. This is usually, and sadly, the production environment.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You, as a developer, should also be aware that serializing and de-serializing
    an object is a heavy operation that costs several CPU cycles. If the structure
    of the application uses only a part of the client state serving most of the HTTP
    requests, then this is a waste of CPU to create the whole state in memory from
    a serialized form and then serializing it again. In such cases, it is more advisable
    to store only a key in the session and use some database (SQL or NoSQL) or some
    other service to store the actual data referenced by the key. Enterprise applications
    almost exclusively use this structure.

    looks at the class and sees that it has an `int` field annotated with `@Inject`
    and `@Named("nrColors")`, and finds in the configuration that such a field should
    have the value 6\. It injects the value to the field before returning the `MastermindHandler`
    object. Similarly, it also injects the values into the other fields, and if it
    should create any of the objects to be injected, it does. If there are fields
    in these objects, then they are also created by injecting other objects and so
    on.

    to create the instances. This is something fairly boring and is not the core feature

    `MastermindHandler` and links them together via the Java object references. This
    way, the dependencies of the different objects (`MastermindHandler` needs `Guesser`,
    `ColorManager`, and `Table`; `ColorManager` needs `ColorFactory`; and `Table`
    also needs `ColorManager`, and so on) become a declaration, specified using annotations
    on the fields. These declarations are inside the code of the classes, and it is
    the right place for them. Where else could we specify what the class needs to
    properly function than in the class itself?

    a case, we should use `getParameterMap`, which returns the whole map with the
    `String` keys and `String[]` values. Even though we do not have multiple values
    for any key this time, and we also know the values of the keys coming as `POST`

    to record information about the operation of code. This is not the core functionality
    of the application but is inevitable to have a program that can be operated. There
    are messages we print out to the log, which can be used by the operating personnel
    to identify environmental issues. For example, when an `IOException` is thrown
    and it gets logged, the operation may look at the logs and identify that the disk
    got full. They may delete files, or add a new disk and extend the partition. Without
    the logs, the only information would be that the program does not work.

    manifest in the test environment and are very difficult to reproduce. In such

    code are the only source of finding the root cause of some error.

- en: Since logging needs CPU, IO bandwidth, and other resources, it should be carefully
    examined what and when to log. This examination and the decisions could be done
    during programming, and as a matter of fact, that is the only possibility if we
    used `System.out.println` for logging. If we need to find a bug, we should log
    a lot. If we log a lot, the performance of the system will go down. The conclusion
    is that we have to log only if it is needed. If there is a bug in the system that
    cannot be reproduced, the developers ask the operation to switch on debug logging
    for a short period. Switching on and off different parts of logging is not possible
    when `System.out.println` is used. When the debug level log is switched on, the
    performance may go down for a while, but at the same time, the logs become available
    for analysis. At the same time, the analysis is simpler when we have to find the
    log lines that are relevant (and you do not know beforehand which are relevant)
    if there is a small (a few hundred megabytes log file) rather than a lot of 2-GB
    compressed log files to find the lines in.

    log messages and log levels. A string usually identifies the logger, and it is
    a common practice to use the name of the class from which the log message is created.

    classes that get the class itself, instead of its name, to get a logger.

    code is added to a program as a dependency that uses a different logging framework,
    it is easy to configure slf4j to send the logs to the loggers of the other framework.
    Thus, the logs will be handled together and not in separate file, which is desirable
    to decrease the cost of operation. When developing your library code or an application
    that uses slf4j, there is no need to select another log framework to slf4j. It
    has its own simple implementation called backlog.'

    if nothing else fails. The major difference from slf4j is that it is more flexible
