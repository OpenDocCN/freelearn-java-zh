- en: '**Domain-driven design** (**DDD**) makes available a set of principles, patterns,
    and techniques that subject-matter experts, architects, developers, and other
    team members can adopt to work together and decompose complex systems into well-factored,
    collaborative, and loosely coupled subsystems. When Eric Evans introduced these
    concepts in the early 2000s, in a lot of ways, these principles were way ahead
    of their time. We were firmly in the age of the monolith, **service-oriented architectures**
    (**SOAs**) as a concept were just starting to take root, and the cloud, microservices,
    continuous delivery, and so on didn’t even exist yet! While it was relatively
    easy to adopt some of its tactical aspects, the strategic side of DDD was still
    seen as an unjustifiable overhead for the most part.'

- en: Fast-forwarding to today, we are building our most complex software solutions
    ever, with even more complex organization and team structures to cope. Also, the
    use of the public cloud is almost a given. This has given rise to a situation
    where distributed teams and applications are almost a norm. Also, we are also
    in an age where applications from an earlier generation need to be modernized.
    All this has resulted in the principles of DDD, specifically the strategic elements,
    gaining a lot of prominence.

- en: We have been practitioners of these concepts and have gained valuable insights
    from our experiences. Over the years, we have seen a number of advancements that
    have made the adoption of DDD at scale a viable option. This book is a distillation
    of all our collective experiences. While we have drawn a lot of inspiration from
    earlier works on the subject, we have been very conscious to apply a practitioner’s
    mindset so that we lower the barrier for teams looking to sustain and thrive in
    their journey of building complex, distributed software.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This book was written with a diverse set of roles and skills in mind. While
    the concepts of DDD have been in existence for a long time, practical application
    and scaling have been a challenge, arguably due to a dearth of practical techniques,
    tools, and real-world examples that bring all these concepts together as a cohesive
    whole. Successful application of these principles requires strong collaboration
    from a varied set of roles and disciplines across an organization, including executives,
    business experts, product owners, business analysts, architects, developers, testers,
    and operators.

    guidelines and techniques to improve the odds of success in our favor. We will
    look at how Eric Evans’ classic book on the subject from 2003 is extremely relevant
    today. We will also introduce the elements of strategic and tactical DDD.'
