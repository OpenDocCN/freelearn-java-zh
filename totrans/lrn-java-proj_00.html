			<h1 id="_idParaDest-7"><a id="_idTextAnchor006"/>Preface</h1>
			<p>Welcome to the world of Java programming! Java is one of the most versatile and widely used programming languages in the world. Its platform independence, object-oriented nature, and extensive library support make it an ideal choice for developing a wide range of applications, from desktop to mobile and <span class="No-Break">enterprise solutions.</span></p>
			<p>Whether you are a novice eager to learn the fundamentals or an experienced developer seeking to enhance your skills, this book is designed to be your comprehensive guide to mastering the Java programming language. We start with the basics: how to get set up with an editor; and primitive data types; and progress systematically to more advanced concepts such as lambdas, streams, <span class="No-Break">and concurrency.</span></p>
			<p>This book is more than just a guide; it’s a companion on your journey to master Java. Our goal is to make this journey enjoyable and effective. This book adopts a hands-on approach, combining theoretical concepts with lots of practical exercises and a capstone project. Whether you are a self-learner or part of a formal educational program, the hands-on exercises and capstone project will help solidify your knowledge, making the learning experience engaging <span class="No-Break">and practical.</span></p>
			<p><em class="italic">Learning by doing</em> is critical in mastering any programming language and we have taken that to heart in this book. At the end of each chapter, you’ll have a few exercises and a project that will help you get some experience with Java. The exercises are typically smaller tasks, and the project is a bit bigger. In all of them, you’ll have quite some freedom to choose how to implement it specifically. Why? Well, because that’s what it’s going to be like in real life as well! We will provide you with a sample solution, but if ours is a bit different, that doesn’t mean yours is bad. If you’re in doubt, ask some AI assistants such as ChatGPT what they think about your solution. Still unclear? We’re always willing to help you <span class="No-Break">as well!</span></p>
			<p>Alright, back to the exercises and projects. We wanted to choose a common theme for our exercises and projects. Believe it or not, but one of your writers (hint: it’s the female one) is surrounded by miniature gigantic historic reptile replicas during the writing of the book. In fact, currently, it’s hard to type because this enormous battery-powered Tyrannosaurus Rex tries to destroy <span class="No-Break">my laptop.</span></p>
			<p>I couldn’t help but draw quite some inspiration from that. So yes, all the exercises and projects will be dinosaur-themed, based on the collection and vivid fantasy play of my 5-year-old son. (I wake up around 5-6 AM. Not by my alarm clock, and definitely not because I’m part of the 5 AM club. No, I have this (most amazing) excited kid telling me fun facts about dinosaurs. Might as well put this knowledge <span class="No-Break">to use!)</span></p>
			<p>So, here’s your context: congratulations, you’re hired! You are now working for our special dinosaur zoo: Mesozoic Eden. It’s a unique blend of prehistoric wilderness and modern comfort, where humans and dinosaurs coexist. People can visit for a day, or camp here for <span class="No-Break">several weeks.</span></p>
			<p>At Mesozoic Eden, we house a rich variety of dinosaur species, each with its distinct behavior and lifestyle, ranging from the colossal Brachiosaurus to the swift-footed Velociraptor, the regal Tyrannosaurus Rex, and many more. We even have a state-of-the-art laboratory where we continue to discover and study new <span class="No-Break">dinosaur breeds.</span></p>
			<p>As part of our team, your role is not only about taking care of these majestic creatures and ensuring their well-being but also about maintaining the safety and security of our guests. Our park employs cutting-edge technology and stringent protocols to ensure a safe environment <span class="No-Break">for all.</span></p>
			<p>In the exercises and projects, you’ll take on various software development tasks as an employee of Mesozoic Eden, from coding software for feeding schedules to the app that handles emergency alerts, ensuring park operations run smoothly, and above all, creating an unforgettable experience for <span class="No-Break">our visitors.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-8"><a id="_idTextAnchor007"/>Who this book is for</h1>
			<p>This book is suitable for beginners looking to take their first steps into programming as well as experienced developers transitioning to Java. Whether you are a student or professional, the content is structured to cater to a <span class="No-Break">diverse audience.</span></p>
			<p>If you are interested in Java 8 OCA Oracle certification, then this book is extremely helpful as it covers many important fundamental concepts by going “under the hood” to explain what is happening in memory. It is no coincidence that both authors are Oracle <span class="No-Break">OCP qualified.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-9"><a id="_idTextAnchor008"/>What this book covers</h1>
