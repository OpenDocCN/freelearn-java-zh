    most-used languages to build robust software applications. Java 9 comes with a
    special emphasis on modularity. Some of the new features of Java 9 are groundbreaking,
    and if you are an experienced programmer, you will be able to make your enterprise
    application leaner by implementing these new features. You will be provided with
    practical guidance in applying the newly acquired knowledge in regards to Java
    9 and further information on future developments of the Java platform. You will
    also work through projects from which you can draw usable examples as you work
    to solve your own unique challenges.
