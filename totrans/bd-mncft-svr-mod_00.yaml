- en: This book is an introduction to programming Minecraft server plugins with the
    Bukkit API. Minecraft is a very versatile sandbox game, and players are always
    looking forward to doing more with it. Bukkit allows programmers to do just that.
    This book is geared towards individuals who may not have a programming background.
    It explains how to set up a Bukkit server and create your own custom plugins that
    can be run on the server. It starts with the basic features of a Bukkit plugin,
    such as commands and permissions, and continues towards advanced concepts, such
    and saving and loading data. This book will help readers create a complete Bukkit
    plugin, irrespective of whether they are new to Java or just new to Bukkit. The
    advanced topics cover portions of the Bukkit API that could even aid the current
    plugin developers in expanding their knowledge in order to improve their existing
    plugins.
