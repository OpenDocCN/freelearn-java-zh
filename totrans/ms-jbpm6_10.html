Of course, we are not foretellers, but when it comes to a technology that we use at the heart of our enterprise architecture and evangelize, we need to understand the place of this system in future computing.</p><p>The computing world is going through a brisk evolution, automation is the key and <span class="strong"><strong>Internet of Things</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong>IoT</strong></span>) is at the <a id="id997" class="indexterm"/>door, revolutionizing the world as we know it. In this short Appendix, we discuss the place of jBPM and the related technologies in the future, by detailing the following trends in computing:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Business programming</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Convergence of enterprise architectures</li></ul></div><div class="section" title="Business programming"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch09lvl1sec60"/>Business programming</h1></div></div></div><p>Enterprise applications<a id="id998" class="indexterm"/> are driven by business needs. In other words, we program these applications to satisfy certain business requirements. Further, in a traditional software development life cycle, the requirements are communicated by the business users to the software developers, who consolidate and convert them into executable implementations.</p><p>This conventional way of developing applications using programming languages has already been superseded by business-level execution languages that talk business (or use business-friendly jargon) such as BPEL. In the current arena, to improve usability and maintainability, they are evolving into applications supporting visual business-oriented programming of which jBPM is a flag bearer.</p><p>"A picture is worth<a id="id999" class="indexterm"/> a thousand words"—this quote can explain why we need visual programming. The objective is obviously to communicate effectively. No longer is programming considered to be wizardry, programs and their logic are part of business operation and should be easily available to people across the organization.</p><p>Further, we can confidently say that this is where programming is being led. The users must be able to view how the operations are done, how decisions are made, and what the impacts of a change are. jBPM modeling facilities are a huge leap into a completely visual programming experience. Currently, the jBPM arsenal allows us to model business processes and business rules. We can model data and user interfaces through a limited but useful functionality, which minimizes the development and deployment costs. We can also simulate a business process and see how it works along with analyzing the related performance metrics.</p><p>Already trending are buzzwords such as IoT or computing everywhere, from the perspective of BPM, these are activities in business operations. Visual programming can help us to encapsulate the logic for communicating with these pervasive devices and give the business, a picture of everyone connected to the process and everyone operating it.</p></div></div>
<div class="section" title="Convergence of enterprise architectures for real-time and predictive analytics"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch09lvl1sec61"/>Convergence of enterprise architectures for real-time and predictive analytics</h1></div></div></div><p>Gone are the days when<a id="id1000" class="indexterm"/> the IT infrastructure contained separate applications for operations, analytics, and administration. Today's IT infrastructure<a id="id1001" class="indexterm"/> needs enterprise application suites that can deliver operations, analytics, and administration together, and can collaborate to share information (in real-time), which makes their functioning more efficient. For example, data from operations is used by analytics to detect fraudulent operations, thereby making operations more secure. Further, the future asks for more seamless interactions between these operations.</p><p>From a technical perspective, we can see these as a merger of multiple design patterns. We can see systems that efficiently<a id="id1002" class="indexterm"/> merge <span class="strong"><strong>service-oriented architecture</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong>SOA</strong></span>) and event-driven architecture. For example, the LAMBDA architecture merges batching, analytics, and service provisioning.</p><p>Such convergence can<a id="id1003" class="indexterm"/> lead to more effective technologies such as predictive analytics. A BPM-based system can be used to produce, consume events, and interact with services. Thus, predictive<a id="id1004" class="indexterm"/> analytics on these events is an obvious improvement. Moreover, BPMs can be used to take action on the results (or decisions) obtained by using these predictive analytic engines. This can have foreseeable applications in the following domains:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Fraud detection.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Suggestive marketing.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">More resilient manufacturing automation, and so on.</li></ul></div><p>The BLIP, that we have already discussed in <a class="link" href="ch01.html" title="Chapter 1. Business Process Modeling – Bridging Business and Technology">Chapter 1</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Business Process Modeling – Bridging Business and Technology</em></span>, is certainly moving to this goal. It provides a way to integrate business logic spread across operations and enable them to work collaboratively to achieve efficient business operations; jBPM is a vital part of BLIP.</p></div></body></html>
