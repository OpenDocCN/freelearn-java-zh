			<p>You already know you want to learn Clojure, and a smart way to learn Clojure is to learn by doing. <em class="italic">The Clojure Workshop</em> focuses on building up your practical skills so that you can write clean, expressive code with a language that is great for applications where concurrency and interoperability with the Java Virtual Machine are a priority. You'll learn from real examples that lead to real results.</p>
			<p>Throughout <em class="italic">The Clojure Workshop</em>, you'll take an engaging step-by-step approach to understanding Clojure. You won't have to sit through any unnecessary theory. If you're short on time, you can jump into a single exercise each day or spend an entire weekend learning about Clojure web development with Ring. It's your choice. Learning on your terms, you'll build up and reinforce key skills in a way that feels rewarding.</p>
			<p>Every physical print copy of <em class="italic">The Clojure Workshop</em> unlocks access to the interactive edition. With videos detailing all exercises and activities, you'll always have a guided solution. You can also benchmark yourself against assessments, track progress, and receive content updates. You'll even earn a secure credential that you can share and verify online upon completion. It's a premium learning experience that's included with your print copy. To redeem it, follow the instructions located at the start of your Clojure book.</p>
			<p>Fast-paced and direct, <em class="italic">The Clojure Workshop</em> is ideal for Clojure beginners. You'll build and iterate on your code like a software developer, learning along the way. This process means that you'll find that your new skills stick, embedded as best practice – a solid foundation for the years ahead.<a id="_idTextAnchor003"/></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-3"><a id="_idTextAnchor004"/>Audience</h2>
			<p><em class="italic">The Clojure Workshop</em> is an ideal tutorial for the Clojure beginner who is just getting started. A basic understanding of JavaScript and Java would be ideal but not necessary. <em class="italic">The Clojure Workshop</em> will guide you well throughout the discussion on the interoperability of these technologies.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-4"><a id="_idTextAnchor005"/>About the Chapters</h2>
			<p><em class="italic">Chapter 1</em>, <em class="italic">Hello REPL!</em>, gets you typing code immediately. You'll learn the basics of the language, as well as how to get the most out of Clojure's interactive REPL.</p>
			<p><em class="italic">Chapter 2</em>, <em class="italic">Data Types and Immutability</em>, provides more building blocks, but these are Clojure building blocks that expose you to one of Clojure's key features: immutability.</p>
			<p><em class="italic">Chapter 3</em>, <em class="italic">Functions in Depth</em>, is a deeper dive into one of the areas that sets Clojure apart: the functional programming paradigm. These are the tools that will power you through the rest of the book.</p>
			<p><em class="italic">Chapter 4</em>, <em class="italic">Mapping and Filtering</em>, is the first stop on your exploration of Clojure collections. The patterns and techniques here are all about learning to solve problems. The map and filter functions are two of the foremost Clojure workhorses.</p>
			<p><em class="italic">Chapter 5</em>, <em class="italic">Many to One: Reducing</em>, will really start getting you thinking in new ways. The data-shaping techniques in this chapter complement those in the previous chapter.</p>
			<p><em class="italic">Chapter 6</em>, <em class="italic">Recursion and Looping</em>, takes your collection techniques to the next level. This chapter will make you think. By the end of the chapter, you'll be ready to handle tricky problems using advanced functional patterns.</p>
			<p><em class="italic">Chapter 7</em>, <em class="italic">Recursion II: Lazy Sequences</em>, completes the panorama of Clojure collections with a look at a distinctive Clojure feature. If you can write functions to process complex tree structures, you are ready to use Clojure to solve big problems.</p>
			<p><em class="italic">Chapter 8</em>, <em class="italic">Namespaces, Libraries, and Leiningen</em>, provides a close look at the tools you need for building real-world Clojure and ClojureScript applications. You have the skills to write good Clojure code; now you need to know how to put your application together.</p>
			<p><em class="italic">Chapter 9</em>, <em class="italic">Host Platform Interoperability with Java and JavaScript</em>, brings you up to speed on a topic that is one of Clojure's great strengths but can also be daunting. As a hosted language, Clojure gives you access to the underlying platform. Knowing how and when to use that power is a key Clojure skill.</p>
			<p><em class="italic">Chapter 10</em>, <em class="italic">Testing</em>, is another important step in serious, real-world programming. Understanding Clojure and ClojureScript testing stories is a skill every professional programmer needs.</p>
			<p><em class="italic">Chapter 11</em>, <em class="italic">Macros</em>, will help you understand a distinctive feature of the Lisp family of languages. Macros allow rich abstraction, but underneath the surface, there are a lot of important practical details.</p>
			<p><em class="italic">Chapter 12</em>, <em class="italic">Concurrency</em>, reveals another unique Clojure strength. This chapter will give you a taste for building multithreaded applications on the Java Virtual Machine or event-driven ClojureScript single-page applications.</p>
			<p><em class="italic">Chapter 13</em>, <em class="italic">Database Interaction and the Application Layer</em>, shows you how to leverage Clojure's database libraries. Many real applications require databases, so these skills are essential.</p>
			<p><em class="italic">Chapter 14</em>, <em class="italic">HTTP with Ring</em>, shows you how to set up and run a Clojure-driven web server. The Ring libraries are the most widely used HTTP technology in the Clojure world.</p>
			<p><em class="italic">Chapter 15</em>, <em class="italic">The Frontend: A ClojureScript UI</em>, helps put together many of the things you've already learned about ClojureScript, the last layer on a Clojure web stack.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-5"><a id="_idTextAnchor006"/>Conventions</h2>
			<p>Code words in text, database table names, folder names, filenames, file extensions, pathnames, dummy URLs, user input, and Twitter handles are shown as follows: "Please note that this function is in the <strong class="source-inline">clojure.string</strong> namespace, which is not referred to by default."</p>
			<p>Words that you see on the screen, for example, in menus or dialog boxes, also appear in the text like this: "When you click on the <strong class="source-inline">Fetch Images</strong> button, the images appear with authors' names."</p>
			<p>A block of code is set as follows:</p>
			<p class="source-code">(defn remove-large-integers [ints]</p>
			<p class="source-code">  (remove #(and (integer? %) (&gt; % 1000)) ints))</p>
			<p>In cases where inputting and executing some code gives an immediate output, this is shown as follows:</p>
			<p class="source-code">user=&gt; (sort [3 7 5 1 9])</p>
			<p class="source-code">(1 3 5 7 9)</p>
			<p>In the example above, the code entered is <strong class="source-inline">(sort [3 7 5 1 9])</strong>, and the output is <strong class="source-inline">(1 3 5 7 9)</strong>.</p>
			<p>New terms and important words are shown like this: "Welcome to the Clojure <strong class="bold">Read Eval Print Loop</strong> (<strong class="bold">REPL</strong>), a command-line interface that we can use to interact with a running Clojure program."</p>

			<h2 id="_idParaDest-6"><a id="_idTextAnchor007"/>Before You Begin</h2>
			<p>Each great journey begins with a humble step. Our upcoming adventure in the land of Clojure is no exception. Before we can do awesome things with data, we need to be prepared with a productive environment. In this section, we will see how to do that.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-7"><a id="_idTextAnchor008"/>Installing Java</h2>
			<p>Before installing Clojure, you need to make sure that you have the <strong class="bold">Java Developer's Kit</strong> (<strong class="bold">JDK</strong>) installed on your computer. For Mac and Linux users, prebuilt binaries are a few keystrokes away. On Mac, for Homebrew users, you can just type:</p>
			<p class="source-code">$ brew install openjdk</p>
			<p>On Debian-based Linux distributions, you can check which version is available by typing the following:</p>
			<p class="source-code">$ apt-get search openjdk</p>
			<p>Depending on the output, you can then type something like:</p>
			<p class="source-code">$ sudo apt-get install openjdk-11-jdk</p>
			<p>Clojure does not require a particularly recent version of the JDK.</p>
			<p>For Windows, you can download the OpenJDK installer here: <a href="https://packt.live/3aBu1Qg">https://packt.live/3aBu1Qg</a>. Once you have the installer, click on it to run, then follow the instructions.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-8"><a id="_idTextAnchor009"/>Installing Clojure</h2>
			<p>Once you have a working JDK on your system, setting up Clojure is easy with the Leiningen tool. </p>
			<ol>
				<li>Copy the appropriate version (Windows or Mac/Linux) from the Leiningen home page, here: <a href="https://leiningen.org/">https://leiningen.org/</a>.</li>
				<li>Place Leiningen in a directory that is part of your system's <strong class="source-inline">$PATH</strong> and make it executable.</li>
				<li>On Mac or Linux, this means putting it in a directory such as <strong class="source-inline">~/bin</strong> and calling <strong class="source-inline">chmod</strong>:<p class="source-code">$ chmod +x ~/bin/lein</p></li>
				<li>On Windows, to change the <strong class="source-inline">$PATH</strong> variable, go to <strong class="source-inline">Control Panel</strong> &gt; <strong class="source-inline">User Accounts</strong> &gt; <strong class="source-inline">User Accounts</strong> and click on <strong class="source-inline">Change My Environment Variables</strong>. In the pane showing the user variables for your personal user account, click on <strong class="source-inline">Path</strong> and then choose <strong class="source-inline">Edit</strong>.<div id="_idContainer008" class="IMG---Figure"><img src="image/B14502_00_01.jpg" alt="Figure 0.1: User accounts&#13;&#10;"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 0.1: User accounts</p></li>
				<li>Click on <strong class="source-inline">New</strong> to add a line, then type in the path to your new <strong class="source-inline">bin</strong> directory:<div id="_idContainer009" class="IMG---Figure"><img src="image/B14502_00_02.jpg" alt="Figure 0.2: Adding the path in bin directory&#13;&#10;"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 0.2: Adding the path in bin directory</p></li>
				<li>Now that Leiningen is installed and executable, from the command line, simply type:<p class="source-code">$ lein</p><p>Leiningen will fetch Clojure and all the libraries it needs to manage Clojure. And now, by simply typing <strong class="source-inline">lein repl</strong>, you'll have your very first Clojure REPL:</p></li>
			</ol>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer010" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B14502_00_03.jpg" alt="Figure 0.3: REPL started&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 0.3: REPL started</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-9">Edi<a id="_idTextAnchor010"/>tors and IDEs</h2>
			<p>While you can certainly do a lot with a REPL running in a console, it's much more convenient to integrate the Clojure REPL into your favorite editor. Plugins exist for just about every editor and environment out there, from Vim to Emacs and from IntelliJ to Electron or Visual Studio Code.</p>
			<p>We can't cover all the possible environments here, but we recommend using the coding tools you are already familiar with and adding a Clojure plugin. The best code editor is the one you enjoy using. As long as there is a Clojure plugin for it, you should be up and running in no time.</p>
