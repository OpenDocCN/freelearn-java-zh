			<h1 id="_idParaDest-115"><a id="_idTextAnchor185"/>Modernization Strategies and Data Integration</h1>
			<p>In today’s fast-paced and data-driven world, businesses constantly strive to keep up with the evolving technology landscape. Modernization has become a key focus for organizations across industries, aiming to improve efficiency, agility, and competitiveness. One critical aspect of modernization is data integration, which plays a pivotal role in harnessing the power of data for informed decision-making. By adopting modernization strategies, avoiding anti-patterns, and leveraging modern cloud services, businesses can unlock the full potential of their data and gain a competitive edge in <span class="No-Break">the market.</span></p>
			<p>Modernization strategies encompass a range of approaches aimed at upgrading legacy systems, processes, and infrastructure to align with contemporary technological advancements. These strategies involve transforming traditional on-premises systems into cloud-based architectures, leveraging microservices and containers for increased scalability and agility, and adopting DevOps practices to streamline development and deployment processes. The ultimate goal is to modernize the entire IT landscape, ensuring it can keep pace with the demands of the <span class="No-Break">digital era</span></p>
			<p>However, modernization efforts can be challenging, and organizations must be mindful of potential anti-patterns that can hinder progress. Anti-patterns are common pitfalls or ineffective practices that can impede successful modernization initiatives. One notable anti-pattern is the lack of proper data integration, where siloed data sources and disparate systems hinder the ability to derive valuable insights. Businesses increasingly adopt <strong class="bold">Change Data Capture</strong> (<strong class="bold">CDC</strong>) techniques to overcome this challenge. CDC allows organizations to capture and propagate real-time data changes, enabling near-instantaneous updates and synchronization between different systems. By implementing CDC, organizations can ensure that their data integration efforts are efficient, accurate, <span class="No-Break">and timely.</span></p>
			<p>An anti-pattern is a recurring solution or approach that initially appears to be the correct way to solve a problem but ultimately leads to negative consequences or <span class="No-Break">suboptimal outcomes.</span></p>
			<p>Cloud computing has revolutionized the IT landscape, providing organizations with unprecedented scalability, flexibility, and cost-efficiency. Cloud-native technologies, such as serverless computing and containerization, enable organizations to build highly scalable and resilient applications that adapt to fluctuating workloads and evolving business needs. By migrating legacy systems to the cloud, businesses can take advantage of robust infrastructure, managed services, and advanced analytics capabilities offered by cloud providers. Furthermore, modernization strategies can significantly benefit from leveraging modern <span class="No-Break">cloud services.</span></p>

			<p>Modernization strategies and data integration are paramount to thrive in the modern business landscape. By embracing modernization, avoiding anti-patterns such as poor data integration, and harnessing the power of modern cloud services, organizations can unlock the true potential of their data, drive innovation, and stay ahead of the competition. The journey toward modernization requires careful planning, a deep understanding of the organization’s goals, and a commitment to leveraging cutting-edge technologies. With the right approach, businesses can navigate the complexities of modernization and pave the way for a successful <span class="No-Break">digital transformation.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-116"><a id="_idTextAnchor186"/>Application modernization strategies</h1>
			<p>Application modernization strategies involve updating and transforming existing legacy applications to <a id="_idIndexMarker426"/>meet the demands of the modern digital landscape. Legacy systems, often characterized by outdated technologies and rigid workflows, can impede an organization’s ability to innovate, respond quickly to market demands, and leverage the full potential of emerging technologies. By implementing application modernization strategies, businesses can revitalize their software assets, enhance scalability, improve performance, and <span class="No-Break">increase agility</span></p>
			<p>Premature optimization is always dangerous; the belief that <em class="italic">monolithic</em> is synonymous with <em class="italic">legacy</em> is a mistake. As software engineers, we need to understand what the business needs and the context. Remember that no silver bullet in any solution includes monolithic and microservices <span class="No-Break">architectural styles.</span></p>
			<p>There are several approaches to<a id="_idIndexMarker427"/> application modernization, each with its benefits and considerations. Let’s explore some of the common strategies and how to apply <span class="No-Break">them effectively:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li>Rehosting, or lift-and-shift, involves moving existing applications to a modern infrastructure without making significant code changes. This strategy offers faster migration with minimal disruption. Replatforming goes further by leveraging cloud-native features or services, such as scalability and managed databases, to optimize the application’s performance. The key is to ensure compatibility and configuration adjustments when moving to new infrastructure—for <a id="_idIndexMarker428"/>example, cloud platforms such as <strong class="bold">Amazon Web Services</strong> (<strong class="bold">AWS</strong>), Microsoft Azure, and <strong class="bold">Google Cloud </strong><span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">Platform</strong></span><span class="No-Break"> (</span><span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">GCP</strong></span><span class="No-Break">).</span></li>
				<li>Refactoring focuses on improving the existing application’s code base, structure, and architecture. This strategy involves making significant code changes, optimizing performance, enhancing scalability, and adopting modular or microservices architectures. The goal is to align the application with modern development practices, such as adopting containerization, decoupling components, and leveraging new frameworks <span class="No-Break">or libraries.</span></li>
				<li>Rebuilding, also known as rewriting, involves starting from scratch while retaining the original application’s functionality and business logic. This strategy allows leveraging modern development frameworks, tools, and architecture patterns. However, it requires careful planning, which can be time-consuming and resource-intensive. It is crucial to analyze the existing application’s strengths and weaknesses to ensure that the new application meets business <span class="No-Break">requirements effectively.</span></li>
				<li>The replacement strategy involves replacing the legacy application entirely with an off-the-shelf commercial <a id="_idIndexMarker429"/>software package or a <strong class="bold">Software-as-a-Service</strong> (<strong class="bold">SaaS</strong>) solution. This approach is suitable when the existing application no longer meets business needs, and it is more cost-effective to adopt a pre-built solution rather than invest in modernizing the <span class="No-Break">legacy system.</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>Implementing legacy modernization<a id="_idIndexMarker430"/> strategies is essential when specific organizational triggers or challenges arise. Let's check common reasons to consider modernization, as legacy <span class="No-Break">technology stacks:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li>Often run on outdated technologies that are no longer supported or lack compatibility with modern software components. This can lead to security vulnerabilities, increased maintenance costs, and limited integration capabilities. Modernization helps mitigate these risks and ensures the application remains viable <span class="No-Break">and secure.</span></li>
				<li>May need help to handle increasing workloads and deliver optimal performance. Modernization enables the application to scale horizontally or vertically, leverage cloud-based resources, and adopt modern architectural patterns, resulting in improved performance <span class="No-Break">and scalability.</span></li>
				<li>Often hinder the adoption of agile development methodologies and DevOps practices due to their monolithic nature and rigid workflows. Application modernization promotes modular design, microservices, and containerization, enabling organizations to embrace agile methods, iterate quickly, and deploy changes <span class="No-Break">more frequently.</span></li>
				<li>May fail to provide a modern user experience or keep up with industry standards, where user expectations evolve and the competition innovate constantly. Modernization strategies can enhance the application’s user interface, introduce new features, and leverage emerging technologies<a id="_idIndexMarker431"/> such as <strong class="bold">artificial intelligence</strong> (<strong class="bold">AI</strong>), <strong class="bold">machine learning</strong> (<strong class="bold">ML</strong>), or <a id="_idIndexMarker432"/><span class="No-Break">mobile platforms.</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>Application modernization strategies are essential for organizations hoping to adapt, innovate, and remain competitive in the digital age. Choosing the appropriate modernization can minimize impacting your business/organization. But before starting this modernization process, review the requirements and goals to understand if it is necessary. Especially when we talk <a id="_idIndexMarker433"/>about the persistent layer, refactoring might be a risk and a considerable cost; it is more trivial than doing code<a id="_idIndexMarker434"/> refactoring with an <strong class="bold">integrated development environment (IDE)</strong>. So, let’s talk about those anti-patterns<a id="_idTextAnchor187"/> <span class="No-Break">in data.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-117"><a id="_idTextAnchor188"/>Avoiding data storage-related anti-patterns and bad practices</h1>
			<p>Several common anti-patterns and bad practices can hinder performance, scalability, and maintainability in an application’s persistence layer. Understanding the difference between anti-patterns and harmful practices is crucial to accurately identify and mitigate <span class="No-Break">these issues.</span></p>
			<p>Anti-patterns are commonly observed in software development and can result from poor design decisions, a lack of understanding, or adherence to outdated practices. Anti-patterns in the <a id="_idIndexMarker435"/>persistence layer can include <span class="No-Break">the following:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Object-relational impedance mismatch</strong>: This anti-pattern occurs when there is a significant <a id="_idIndexMarker436"/>disconnect between the <strong class="bold">object-oriented</strong> (<strong class="bold">OO</strong>) model <a id="_idIndexMarker437"/>used in the application’s code and the relational model used in the database. It can lead to excessive mapping and conversion logic, performance degradation, and complexity in maintaining data consistency. To avoid<a id="_idIndexMarker438"/> this anti-pattern, consider using <strong class="bold">object-relational mapping</strong> (<strong class="bold">ORM</strong>) frameworks that provide seamless integration between the application code and the database, reducing the <span class="No-Break">impedance mismatch.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Data access in the presentation layer</strong>: This anti-pattern involves performing data access operations directly in the presentation layer, such as in user interface components. It violates the principle of <strong class="bold">separation of concerns</strong> (<strong class="bold">SoC</strong>), leading to<a id="_idIndexMarker439"/> tightly coupled code, difficulty in maintaining and testing, and decreased reusability. While rarely recommended, there are a few good uses of data retrieval directly from the presentation layer. To address this, follow a layered <a id="_idIndexMarker440"/>architecture pattern (such as <strong class="bold">Model View Controller (MVC)</strong> or <strong class="bold">Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM)</strong>, where data access <a id="_idIndexMarker441"/>operations are performed in a separate data <span class="No-Break">access layer.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Querying the database in a loop</strong>: This anti-pattern occurs when an application performs individual database queries within a loop instead of using bulk operations. It results in excessive database round trips, increased network <a id="_idIndexMarker442"/>overhead, and poor performance. To avoid this, optimize queries using batch processing, bulk inserts or updates, and caching mechanisms to minimize the number of <span class="No-Break">database interactions.</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>Bad practices, on the other hand, refer to actions or habits that are generally recognized as inefficient, suboptimal, or detrimental to the overall quality of the software. Unlike anti-patterns, bad practices may not necessarily be recurring solutions but specific actions or choices that should be avoided. Some examples of bad practices in the<a id="_idIndexMarker443"/> persistence layer include <span class="No-Break">the following:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Lack of connection pooling</strong>: Failing to utilize connection pooling can lead to performance issues, especially in high-traffic applications. Opening and closing database connections for every request or operation can result in resource contention, increased overhead, and decreased scalability. Implementing connection pooling techniques provided by database drivers or frameworks to manage connections efficiently <span class="No-Break">is essential.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Failure to use prepared statements or parameterized queries</strong>: Constructing SQL queries by directly concatenating user input or dynamic values can expose the application to SQL injection attacks. It is essential to use prepared statements or parameterized queries, which ensure that user input is treated as data rather than executable code, thereby mitigating <span class="No-Break">security risks.</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>To avoid anti-patterns and bad practices in the persistence layer, consider the <span class="No-Break">following approaches:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Educate and train developers</strong>: Ensure developers have a solid understanding <a id="_idIndexMarker444"/>of best practices, design patterns, and modern approaches to persistence. Provide<a id="_idIndexMarker445"/> training sessions, workshops, or resources to update them on industry standards and <span class="No-Break">emerging technologies.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Follow design principles and patterns</strong>: Apply <a id="_idIndexMarker446"/>design principles such as <strong class="bold">SOLID</strong> (which stands for <strong class="bold">Single Responsibility, Open-Closed, Liskov Substitution, Interface Segregation, Dependency Inversion</strong>) and use appropriate design patterns<a id="_idIndexMarker447"/> such as <strong class="bold">Data Access Object</strong> (<strong class="bold">DAO</strong>), repository, or ORM patterns. These principles and patterns promote SoC, modularity, <span class="No-Break">and maintainability.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Use ORM or query builders</strong>: Adopt ORM frameworks or query builders that provide abstraction layers to handle database<a id="_idIndexMarker448"/> interactions. ORM tools, such as Hibernate, <strong class="bold">Entity Framework</strong> (<strong class="bold">EF</strong>), or Sequelize, can help reduce object-relational impedance mismatches and handle data access <span class="No-Break">operations efficiently.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Implement connection pooling</strong>: Utilize connection pooling techniques provided by database drivers or frameworks to efficiently manage and reuse database connections. Connection pooling helps avoid the overhead of establishing new connections for each request, improving performance <span class="No-Break">and scalability.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Sanitize user input and use prepared statements</strong>: Always filter and sanitize user input and avoid directly concatenating dynamic values into SQL queries. Instead, utilize prepared statements or parameterized queries provided by the database APIs. This approach prevents SQL injection attacks and many user input errors by treating user input as a vulnerability rather than <span class="No-Break">trustworthy input.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Perform code reviews and refactoring</strong>: Conduct regular code reviews to identify anti-patterns, bad practices, and areas for improvement. Encourage a culture of continuous improvement where developers can provide feedback, suggest enhancements, and refactor code to align with <span class="No-Break">best practices.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Test and benchmark performance</strong>: Implement thorough unit tests and integration tests to validate the correctness of data access operations. Conduct performance testing and benchmarking to identify bottlenecks and optimize query execution times. Tools such as JMeter or Gatling can help simulate load and measure <span class="No-Break">performance metrics.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Stay updated and engage in the community</strong>: Stay informed about the latest advancements, updates, and best practices in persistence technologies and frameworks. Engage<a id="_idIndexMarker449"/> with the development community through forums, conferences, or online communities to share experiences, learn from others, and discover <span class="No-Break">new techniques.</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>Adopting these practices and <a id="_idIndexMarker450"/>maintaining a proactive approach to code quality and performance optimization can significantly reduce the occurrence of anti-patterns and bad practices in the persistence layer, leading to more robust, maintainable, and scalable applications. Talking about good practices, in the following session, we’ll explore the most modern one, CDC, and how it can help you on your journey <a id="_idTextAnchor189"/>on the <span class="No-Break">persistence layer.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-118"><a id="_idTextAnchor190"/>Introduction to CDC pattern</h1>
			<p><strong class="bold">Change Data Capture</strong> (<strong class="bold">CDC</strong>) is a technique <a id="_idIndexMarker451"/>used to track and capture changes made to data in a database. It enables organizations to identify, capture, and propagate data changes in near-real time, providing a reliable and efficient data integration and synchronization method across <span class="No-Break">different systems.</span></p>
			<p>The following diagram shows a sample using the CDC pattern where we have a source that fires an event, and based on this event, each subscriber results in two <span class="No-Break">database targets:</span></p>
			<div>
				<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer070">
					<img alt="Figure 11.1 – CDC architecture representation" src="image/Figure_11.01_B19375.jpg"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 11.1 – CDC architecture representation</p>
			<p>The process of CDC involves monitoring and capturing changes that occur at the database level, such as inserts, updates, and deletes, and emitting these as individual events. Instead of constantly polling the entire database for<a id="_idIndexMarker452"/> changes, CDC mechanisms track and capture only the modified data, reducing unnecessary overhead and <span class="No-Break">improving performance.</span></p>
			<p>Let’s look at some further advantages <span class="No-Break">of CDC:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Real-time data integration</strong>: CDC enables organizations to capture and propagate <a id="_idIndexMarker453"/>data changes in near-real time, ensuring that the integrated systems can access the most up-to-date information. This real-time data integration allows more accurate reporting, analytics, <span class="No-Break">and decision-making.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Improved data consistency</strong>: By capturing and synchronizing data changes across different systems, CDC helps maintain data consistency and integrity. Updates made in one design can be automatically reflected in other systems, eliminating the need for manual data entry or <span class="No-Break">batch processes.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Reduced latency</strong>: CDC significantly reduces the latency between data changes and their availability in other systems. It is particularly important for scenarios where timely access to the latest data is critical, such as in financial transactions, inventory management, or <span class="No-Break">real-time analytics.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Minimized impact on source systems</strong>: Unlike traditional batch-based data integration approaches, CDC reduces the impact on the source systems by capturing changes<a id="_idIndexMarker454"/> incrementally rather than extracting and loading large datasets. It reduces the load on the source systems and avoids <span class="No-Break">performance degradation.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Efficient data replication</strong>: CDC enables efficient data replication across databases or systems. It only captures and transmits the changed data, reducing network bandwidth requirements and improving <span class="No-Break">replication performance.</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>CDC is advantageous in the <span class="No-Break">following scenarios:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Data warehousing and business intelligence (BI)</strong>: CDC facilitates the integration of operational databases with data warehouses or data lakes, ensuring that analytics, transaction processing, and reporting systems have access to the most current data. It enables organizations to make data-driven decisions based on <span class="No-Break">up-to-date information.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Microservices and event-driven architecture (EDA)</strong>: CDC is valuable in EDA, where changes in <a id="_idIndexMarker455"/>one microservice trigger actions in other microservices. By capturing data changes in real time, CDC allows microservices to react to and process the latest data updates, ensuring consistency across <span class="No-Break">the system.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Data synchronization and replication</strong>: When multiple databases or systems need to be synchronized and kept up to date with each other, CDC provides an efficient mechanism for capturing and propagating changes. This is particularly relevant in scenarios involving distributed systems, multi-site deployments, or <a id="_idIndexMarker456"/>data replication for <strong class="bold">disaster recovery</strong> (<span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">DR</strong></span><span class="No-Break">) purposes.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Legacy system integration</strong>: CDC can be used to integrate legacy systems with modern applications or databases. By capturing changes from legacy systems and propagating them to modern systems, organizations can leverage the capabilities <a id="_idIndexMarker457"/>of new technologies while maintaining the functionality of <span class="No-Break">existing systems.</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>While CDC can be highly beneficial in many scenarios, there are certain situations where it may not be the most suitable approach. Here are some cases when CDC might not be the <span class="No-Break">best choice:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Infrequent or low-impact data changes</strong>: If the data changes in your system are<a id="_idIndexMarker458"/> irregular or have a minimal impact on downstream systems, implementing CDC might introduce unnecessary complexity. In such cases, traditional batch-based data extraction and loading processes <span class="No-Break">may suffice.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Small-scale or simple applications</strong>: For small-scale applications with limited data sources and straightforward integration requirements, the overhead of implementing CDC may outweigh the benefits. CDC is advantageous in complex, large-scale environments with multiple systems <span class="No-Break">and databases.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Strict real-time requirements</strong>: Although CDC provides near-real-time data integration, it might not be suitable for scenarios that demand immediate or sub-second data propagation. Alternative approaches such as event sourcing or streaming platforms may be <span class="No-Break">more appropriate.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">High-frequency and high-volume data changes</strong>: If your system experiences an extremely high frequency or volume of data changes, implementing CDC may burden the source database and infrastructure. In such cases, it may be more efficient to consider alternative data integration techniques that can handle the <span class="No-Break">scale effectively.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Data security and compliance concerns</strong>: CDC may not be recommended when data security or compliance regulations strictly prohibit or limit data replication or movement. Evaluating and adhering to data governance and compliance requirements is crucial before <span class="No-Break">implementing CDC.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Cost and resource constraints</strong>: CDC implementations often require additional infrastructure, monitoring, and maintenance overhead. If you have budget constraints or limited resources to manage and support CDC, alternative data integration methods might be <span class="No-Break">more feasible.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Legacy systems with limited capabilities</strong>: Some legacy systems may need more functionality or capabilities to support CDC. In such cases, retrofitting CDC mechanisms into these systems may be challenging or impractical. Consider alternative integration approaches or explore options for modernizing the <span class="No-Break">legacy system.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Lack of integration requirements</strong>: CDC may not be necessary if your system does not<a id="_idIndexMarker459"/> require integration with other systems or databases and operates as a standalone application without data synchronization. Evaluate the integration needs and assess whether CDC adds value to your <span class="No-Break">use case.</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>Remember—whether or not to use CDC depends on your system’s requirements, complexity, and characteristics. It is essential to analyze your use case thoroughly, consider consider its up and downsides, and evaluate alternative data integration techniques before <span class="No-Break">implementing CDC.</span></p>
			<p>In summary, CDC is a powerful technique for capturing and propagating data changes in near-real time. Its <a id="_idIndexMarker460"/>benefits include <span class="No-Break">the following:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li>Real-time <span class="No-Break">data integration</span></li>
				<li>Improved <span class="No-Break">data consistency</span></li>
				<li><span class="No-Break">Reduced latency</span></li>
				<li>Minimized impact on <span class="No-Break">source systems</span></li>
				<li>Efficient <span class="No-Break">data replication</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>CDC is particularly valuable in data warehousing, microservices, EDA, data synchronization, replication, and legacy <span class="No-Break">system integration</span></p>
			<p>It is colossal work, and the good news is we can do it with others; public cloud offerings have multiplied and can help us a lot, especially in focusing more on the business and delegating what is not our core. When we talk about services in the cloud, one<a id="_idIndexMarker461"/> is implicit: DBaaS, where we don’t need to be an expert or have one close to us; let’s explore<a id="_idTextAnchor191"/> more about it in the <span class="No-Break">next section.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-119"><a id="_idTextAnchor192"/>Adopting cloud technologies and cloud services</h1>
			<p>Cloud services offer numerous advantages for the persistence layer of an application, providing enhanced database experiences and relieving organizations from various management and<a id="_idIndexMarker462"/> maintenance tasks. One particular service in this context is <strong class="bold">Database-as-a-Service</strong> (<strong class="bold">DBaaS</strong>), which allows users to leverage the power of databases without the need for extensive expertise <a id="_idIndexMarker463"/>or <span class="No-Break">infrastructure management.</span></p>
			<p>DBaaS are traditional; setting up and managing databases involves significant effort, including hardware provisioning, software installation, configuration, and ongoing maintenance. However, DBaaS <a id="_idIndexMarker464"/>shifts these responsibilities to the <strong class="bold">cloud service provider</strong> (<strong class="bold">CSP</strong>), enabling users to focus more on their application development and <span class="No-Break">business logic.</span></p>
			<p>Here are some ways in which cloud services, particularly DBaaS, can benefit the <span class="No-Break">persistence layer:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Simplified database management</strong>: DBaaS abstracts the complexities of managing<a id="_idIndexMarker465"/> databases, making it easier for developers and teams to handle the persistence layer. <strong class="bold">Service providers</strong> (<strong class="bold">SPs</strong>) handle tasks such as database installation, patching, and upgrades, relieving users of these time-consuming and sometimes <span class="No-Break">error-prone activities.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Scalability and performance</strong>: Cloud services offer the ability to scale databases vertically (increasing the resources of a single instance) or horizontally (adding more models to distribute the load). This scalability ensures that databases can handle increasing workloads and provide optimal performance to meet the <span class="No-Break">application’s demands.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Automated backup and recovery</strong>: CSPs typically offer automatic database backup and recovery mechanisms. This ensures that regular backups are taken, reducing the risk of data loss. Additionally, in the event of a disaster or failure, the cloud provider can facilitate quick and efficient recovery, minimizing downtime and ensuring <span class="No-Break">data availability.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">High Availability (HA) and Fault Tolerance (FT)</strong>: Cloud services often provide built-in mechanisms for achieving HA and FT in database systems. These include automatic failover, replication, and geographically distributed data centers. Such <a id="_idIndexMarker466"/>capabilities help ensure that the database remains accessible and resilient, even in the face of hardware failures or <span class="No-Break">network outages.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Security and compliance</strong>: CSPs prioritize safety and invest in robust infrastructure and data protection measures. They implement industry-standard security practices, encryption mechanisms, and compliance certifications. This allows organizations to benefit from the provider’s expertise and focus on ensuring the security and compliance of their data without having to build and maintain such <span class="No-Break">measures themselves.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Cost-efficiency</strong>: Using cloud services for the persistence layer can be cost-effective, eliminating the need to invest in expensive hardware infrastructure and reducing ongoing maintenance and operational costs. Cloud providers typically offer pricing models that align with actual usage, allowing organizations to pay for the resources they consume rather than making significant <span class="No-Break">upfront investments.</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>By leveraging cloud services, organizations can offload the responsibility of managing databases and focus on their core business objectives. The “somebody else’s computer” joke highlights the advantage of delegating database-related issues to cloud providers. The SP takes care of tasks such as upgrading the database, backup and recovery, partitioning data, ensuring scalability, freeing up resources, and reducing the complexity of managing these <span class="No-Break">aspects in-house.</span></p>
			<p>Cloud services, particularly DBaaS, empower organizations to leverage robust, scalable, and highly available databases without needing extensive expertise or infrastructure management. With simplified management, enhanced scalability, automated backup and recovery, HA, security measures, and cost-efficiency, cloud services offer a valuable solution for the p<a id="_idTextAnchor193"/>ersistence layer of <span class="No-Break">modern applications.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-120"><a id="_idTextAnchor194"/>Summary</h1>
			<p>In this book, we explored various aspects of application modernization, focusing on strategies, anti-patterns, and ways to leverage modern cloud services to enhance the persistence layer of applications. We stressed the importance of adopting modernization strategies to keep pace with evolving technologies and meet the ever-changing needs of users <span class="No-Break">and businesses.</span></p>
			<p>We discussed the significance of avoiding anti-patterns and bad practices in the persistence layer, as they can hinder application performance, maintainability, and scalability. Developers can ensure a robust and efficient persistence layer by understanding these anti-patterns and their impact and by implementing best practices such as proper design principles, ORM frameworks, and <span class="No-Break">connection pooling.</span></p>

CDC enables real-time data integration, improved data consistency, and efficient data replication, making it a valuable technique in various scenarios such as data warehousing, microservices architectures, and <span class="No-Break">data synchronization.</span></p>
			<p>Furthermore, we delved into the advantages of cloud services, specifically DBaaS, in simplifying database management, enhancing scalability, providing automated backup and recovery, ensuring HA and FT, and addressing security and compliance concerns. By leveraging DBaaS, organizations can offload database-related tasks to cloud providers and focus on their <span class="No-Break">core objectives.</span></p>
			<p>As we conclude this book, we have covered fundamental concepts and practices related to application modernization, persistence layer optimization, and leveraging cloud services. The following chapters summarize our discussion, providing key takeaways and final considerations to guide your application <span class="No-Break">modernization journey.</span></p>
			<p>Remember—staying up to date with emerging technologies, adhering to best practices, and embracing cloud services can empower you to build modern, efficient, and scalable applications that meet the demands of today’s dynamic digital landscape. By adopting a proactive approach to modernization and leveraging the power of cloud services, you can position your applications for success in the ever-evolving world <span class="No-Break">of technology.</span></p>
