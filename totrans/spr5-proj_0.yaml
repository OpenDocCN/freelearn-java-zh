- en: '[Chapter 1](87add83e-e65b-4b58-9ef1-113ad157a51a.xhtml), *Creating an Application
    to List World Countries with their GDP*, is about kick-starting your Spring-based
    web application development. We will focus on creating a web application using
    Spring MVC, Spring Data, and the World Bank API for some statistics on different
    countries, and a MySQL database. The core data for the application will be from
    the sample world database that comes with MySQL. The UI for this application will
    be powered by Angular.js. We will follow the WAR model for application deployment
    and will deploy on the latest version of Tomcat.'

    its features and functionality.'
