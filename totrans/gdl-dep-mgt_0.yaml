  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When we write code in our Java or Groovy project, we mostly have dependencies
    on other projects or libraries. For example, we could use the Spring framework
    in our project, so we are dependent on classes found in the Spring framework.
    We want to be able to manage such dependencies from Gradle, our build automation
    tool.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We will see how we can define and customize the dependencies we need. We learn
    not only how to define the dependencies, but also how to work with repositories
    that store the dependencies. Next, we will see how to customize the way Gradle
    resolves dependencies.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Besides being dependent on other libraries, our project can also be a dependency
    for other projects. This means that we need to know how to deploy our project
    artifacts so that other developers can use it. We learn how to define artifacts
    and how to deploy them to, for example, a Maven or Ivy repository.

- en: '[Chapter 1](part0014.xhtml#aid-DB7S1 "Chapter 1. Defining Dependencies"), *Defining
    Dependencies,* introduces dependency configurations as a way to organize dependencies.
    You will learn about the different types of dependencies in Gradle.'

- en: '[Chapter 2](part0021.xhtml#aid-K0RQ2 "Chapter 2. Working with Repositories"),
    *Working with Repositories*, covers how we can define repositories that store
    our dependencies. We will see not only how to set the location, but also the layout
    of a repository.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[Chapter 3](part0024.xhtml#aid-MSDG2 "Chapter 3. Resolving Dependencies"),
    *Resolving Dependencies,* is about how Gradle resolves our dependencies. You will
    learn how to customize the dependency resolution and resolve conflicts between
    dependencies.'

- en: '[Chapter 4](part0030.xhtml#aid-SJGS1 "Chapter 4. Publishing Artifacts"), *Publishing
    Artifacts*, covers how to define artifacts for our project to be published as
    dependencies for others. We will see how to use configurations to define artifacts.
    We also use a local directory as a repository to publish the artifacts.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[Chapter 5](part0036.xhtml#aid-12AK81 "Chapter 5. Publishing to a Maven Repository"),
    *Publishing to a Maven Repository*, looks at how to publish our artifacts to a
    Maven repository. You will learn how to define a publication for a Maven-like
    repository, such as Artifactory or Nexus, and how to use the new and incubating
    publishing feature of Gradle.'

- en: '[Chapter 6](part0044.xhtml#aid-19UOO1 "Chapter 6. Publishing to Bintray"),
    *Publishing to Bintray*, covers how to deploy our artifacts to Bintray. Bintray
    calls itself a Distribution as a Service and provides a low-level way to publish
    our artifacts to the world. In this chapter, we will look at how to use the Bintray
    Gradle plugin to publish our artifacts.'

- en: '[Chapter 7](part0049.xhtml#aid-1ENBI1 "Chapter 7. Publishing to an Ivy Repository"),
    *Publishing to an Ivy Repository*, is about publishing our artifacts to an Ivy
    repository. We will look into the different options to publish our artifacts to
    an Ivy repository, which is actually quite similar to publishing to a Maven repository.'
