- en: Welcome to the world of Java programming! Java is one of the most versatile
    and widely used programming languages in the world. Its platform independence,
    object-oriented nature, and extensive library support make it an ideal choice
    for developing a wide range of applications, from desktop to mobile and enterprise
    solutions.

    developer seeking to enhance your skills, this book is designed to be your comprehensive
    guide to mastering the Java programming language. We start with the basics: how
    to get set up with an editor; and primitive data types; and progress systematically
    to more advanced concepts such as lambdas, streams, and concurrency.'

    Java. Our goal is to make this journey enjoyable and effective. This book adopts
    a hands-on approach, combining theoretical concepts with lots of practical exercises
    and a capstone project. Whether you are a self-learner or part of a formal educational
    program, the hands-on exercises and capstone project will help solidify your knowledge,
    making the learning experience engaging and practical.

    have taken that to heart in this book. At the end of each chapter, you’ll have
    a few exercises and a project that will help you get some experience with Java.
    The exercises are typically smaller tasks, and the project is a bit bigger. In
    all of them, you’ll have quite some freedom to choose how to implement it specifically.
    Why? Well, because that’s what it’s going to be like in real life as well! We
    will provide you with a sample solution, but if ours is a bit different, that
    doesn’t mean yours is bad. If you’re in doubt, ask some AI assistants such as
    ChatGPT what they think about your solution. Still unclear? We’re always willing
    to help you as well!'

    this enormous battery-powered Tyrannosaurus Rex tries to destroy my laptop.'

    definitely not because I’m part of the 5 AM club. No, I have this (most amazing)
