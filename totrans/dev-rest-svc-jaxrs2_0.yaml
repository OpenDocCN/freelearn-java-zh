- en: Over the years, we have seen several revolutions, and shifts in paradigms spanning
    from mainframes to x86 farms, from heavyweight methodologies to lightweight agile
    methods, and from desktop and thick clients to thin, rich, and highly available
    web applications and ubiquitous computing.

- en: With the advancements and changes in the technology landscape going towards
    smaller, more portable, and lightweight devices and the devices being used widely
    for day-to-day activities, the need to push the computation from the client machines
    to the backend grows to an even more prominent one. This also brings forth opportunities
    and challenges involved in developing applications with near real-time or real-time
    event and data propagation between servers and clients; that is where HTML 5 provides
    developers with the standards, API, and flexibility required to achieve the same
    result in web applications that is achievable in thick desktop applications.

- en: The communication between clients and the servers has turned to the most fundamental
    subject both in terms of quantity, content, interoperability, and scalability
    of these interactions. The XML era, long waiting requests, single browser, and
    single device compatibility is over; instead the era of devices, multiple clients,
    and browsers, from very small devices capable of only processing text over HTTP
    to mammoth scale machines processing almost any kind of content has begun. With
    this said, producing the content and accepting the content along with the ability
    to switch between older and newer protocols has turned into an obvious must.

- en: Java EE 7 comes with more emphasis on these emerging (and dominating) requirements;
    support for HTML5, more asynchronous communication/invocation-capable components,
    and support for JSON as one of the data formats have arrived to help developers
    with resolving the technical requirements and giving the developers ample time
    to work on the business requirements' implementation of their systems.

    what Java EE is in general and Java EE 7 in particular, as a technology platform,
    provides for developing lightweight, interactive applications based on HTML5 deployable
    in any Java EE compatible container.

    *Building RESTful Web Services Using JAX-RS*, starts with the basic concepts of
    building RESTful Web Services and covers JAX-RS 2.0 API, detailing the different
    annotations, Providers, `MessageBodyReader`, `MessageBodyWriter`, Client API,
    and Bean Validation support in JAX-RS 2.0.'

    and Server-sent Events*, discusses the different programming models for sending
    near real-time updates to clients. It also covers WebSockets and Server-sent Events,
    the JavaScript and Java API for WebSockets and Server-sent Events. This chapter
    compares and contrasts WebSockets and Server-sent Events and shows the advantages
    of WebSockets to reduce unnecessary network traffic and improve the performance.'

    Events in Detail"), *Understanding WebSockets and Server-sent Events in Detail*,
    covers the Java EE 7 API for WebSockets, Encoders and Decoders, the Client API,
    how to send different kinds of messages with WebSockets using blobs, and `ArrayBuffers`.
    It teaches how to secure a WebSockets-based application. It outlines the best
    practices for WebSockets and Server-sent Events-based applications.'

    and Asynchronous Processing*, covers the Java EE 7 JSON-P API for parsing and
    manipulating JSON data. It also discusses the new NIO API introduced in Servlet
    3.1 specification. It teaches how to use the JAX-RS 2.0 API for asynchronous request
    processing to improve scalability.'

    Web Services by Example*, covers two real-life examples of RESTful Web Services.
    It covers an event notification sample based on the Twitter Search API, how the
    server can push the data to clients as and when events occur. A library application
    ties the different technologies covered in the above chapters together.'
