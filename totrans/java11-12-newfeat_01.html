<p class="mce-root">This section will help you get started with type inferencing, which was one of the main features of Java 10. We will then learn about application class data sharing, which helps in selecting application classes in the shared archived files. Moving on, we will explore more about the GC interface and parallel full GC for G1. Lastly, we will cover the remaining additions or updates to Java 10, most of which are related to changes in the JDK or its implementation.</p>
