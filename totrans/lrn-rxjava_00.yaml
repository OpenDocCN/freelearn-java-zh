- en: Reactive programming is more than a technology or library specification. It
    is an entirely new mindset in how we solve problems. The reason it is so effective
    and revolutionary is it does not structure our world as a series of states, but
    rather something that is constantly in motion. Being able to quickly capture the
    complexity and dynamic nature of movement (rather than state) opens up powerful
    new possibilities in how we represent things with code.

- en: When I first learned Java and object-oriented programming, I felt it was useful,
    but not effective enough. Although OOP is useful, I believed it needed to be paired
    with something else to be truly productive, which is why I keep an eye on C# and
    Scala. Only a few years later, Java 8 came out, and I put functional programming
    into practice for the first time.

- en: However, something was still missing. I became fascinated with the idea of a
    value notifying another value of its change, and an event triggering another event
    in a domino effect. Was there not a way to model events in a fluent and functional
    way, much like Java 8 Streams? When I voiced this idea one day, somebody introduced
    me to reactive programming. What I was looking for was the RxJava Observable,
    which, at first glance, looked a lot like a Java 8 Stream. The two look and feel
    similar, but the Observable *pushes* not just data but also events. At that moment,
    I found exactly what I was looking for.

- en: For me, as well as many others, a challenge in learning RxJava is the lack of
    documentation and literature. I was often left experimenting, asking questions
    on Stack Overflow, and trawling obscure issues on GitHub to become knowledgeable.
    As I used RxJava heavily for some business problems at work, I wrote several blog
    articles, sharing my discoveries on topics such as parallelization and concurrency.
    To my surprise, these articles exploded with traffic. Perhaps this should not
    have been surprising since these topics were sparsely documented anywhere else.
    When Packt approached me to write my second book, *Learning RxJava*, I jumped
    at the opportunity despite the work involved. Maybe, just maybe, this book can
    solve the documentation problem once and for all. Every fundamental concept, use
    case, helpful trick, and "gotcha" can be made accessible, and RxJava will no longer
    be considered an "advanced topic." I believe RxJava should be made accessible
    to professional developers of all skill levels, as it effectively makes hard problems
    easy and easy problems even easier. It may require a bit more abstract understanding,
    but the immediate productivity gained makes this small hurdle worthwhile.

    has many major differences from RxJava 1.0\. This book you are reading now is
    the comprehensive, step-by-step guide that I wish I had. It strives to not cut
    any corners or present code without thorough explanation. I hope it helps you
    quickly find value in RxJava, and you become successful in applying it to all
    your endeavors. If you have any concerns, feedback, or comments, you are welcome
    to reach out to me at tmnield@outlook.com.

    programing and core Java features. You should be familiar with variables, types,
    classes, properties, methods, generics, inheritance, interfaces, and static classes/properties/methods.
    In the Java standard library, you should at least be familiar with collections
    (including Lists, Sets, and Maps) as well as object equality (`hashcode()`/`equals()`).
    If any of these topics sound unfamiliar, you may want to read *Java: A Beginner’s
    Guide* by Herbert Schildt to learn the fundamentals of Java. Also, *Effective
    Java (2nd Edition)* by Joshua Bloch is a classic book that should be on every
    Java developer’s shelf. This book strives to use the best practices cited by Bloch.'
