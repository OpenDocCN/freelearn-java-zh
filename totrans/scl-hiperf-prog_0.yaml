- en: Scala is an audacious programming language that blends object-oriented and functional
    programming concepts on the JVM. Scala has grown from relative obscurity to a
    top choice for developing robust and maintainable JVM applications. However, writing
    highly performant applications remains a challenge without a deep understanding
    of the language and the advanced features that it provides.

- en: Since 2011, we have used Scala to solve complex business challenges with demanding
    performance requirements. In *Scala High Performance Programming*, we share the
    lessons that we have learned over the years and the techniques we apply when writing
    software. We explore the language and its ecosystem of tools and widely-used libraries
    in this book.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Our goal with this book is to help you understand the options that are made
    available to you by the language. We empower you to gather the information that
    is needed to make informed design and implementation decisions in your software
    systems. Rather than feed you a few Scala-fish and send you on your way, we help
    you learn how to fish and give you the tools to write more functional and more
    performant software. Along the way, we motivate technical discussions by concocting
    business problems that are reminiscent of real-world problems. We hope that by
    reading this book, you can come to appreciate the power of Scala, and find the
    tools to write more functional and more performant applications.

    the Collection API*, discusses various collection abstractions that are provided
    by the standard Scala library. We focus on eagerly evaluated collections in this
    chapter.'

    Collections and Event Sourcing*, is an advanced chapter that discusses two types
    of lazy sequences: views and streams. We also give a brief overview of the event
    sourcing paradigm.'

    for Performance*, this closing chapter combines deeper knowledge on previously

    This chapter also explores load control policies with the free monad to build
    systems with bounded latency characteristics when facing high throughput.'

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You should install Java Development Kit version 8 or higher for your operating
    system to work through all code examples. This book discusses the Oracle HotSpot
    JVM, and it demonstrates tools that are included in Oracle JDK. You should also
    get the latest version of `sbt` (version 0.13.11, at the time of writing) from
    [http://www.scala-sbt.org/download.html](http://www.scala-sbt.org/download.html).

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You should possess a basic knowledge of the Scala programming language, have
    some familiarity with elementary functional programming concepts, and have experience
    of writing production-level JVM software. We recommend that readers who are new
    to Scala and functional programming spend some time studying other resources before
    reading this book in order to get the best out of it. Two excellent Scala-centric
    resources are *Programming in Scala*, *Artima Press* and *Functional Programming
    in Scala*, *Manning Publications*. The former is best suited for strong object-oriented
    Java programmers that are looking to understand the language first and the functional
    programming paradigm second. The latter focuses heavily on the functional programming
    paradigm and less so on language-specific constructs.
