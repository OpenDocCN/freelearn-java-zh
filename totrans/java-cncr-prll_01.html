			<h1 id="_idParaDest-18"><a id="_idTextAnchor017"/>The dual pillars of concurrency versus parallelism – a kitchen analogy</h1>
			<p>Welcome to the kitchen of Java concurrency and parallelism! Here, we’ll whisk you through a culinary journey, unveiling the art of multitasking and high-speed cooking in programming. Imagine juggling different tasks like a master chef – that’s concurrency. Then, picture multiple chefs cooking in harmony for a grand feast – that’s parallelism. Get ready to spice up your Java applications with these essential skills, from handling user interactions to crunching massive data. Bon appétit to the world of efficient and responsive <span class="No-Break">Java cooking!</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-19"><a id="_idTextAnchor018"/>Defining concurrency</h2>
			<p>In Java, concurrency<a id="_idIndexMarker002"/> allows a program to manage multiple tasks such that they seem to run simultaneously, enhancing performance even on single-core systems. A <strong class="bold">core</strong> refers to <a id="_idIndexMarker003"/>a processing unit within a computer’s CPU that is capable of executing programming instructions. While true parallel execution requires multiple cores, with each core handling a different task at the same time, Java’s concurrency mechanisms can create the illusion of parallelism by efficiently scheduling and executing tasks in a way that maximizes the use of available resources. They can do this on a single- or multi-core system. This approach enables Java programs to achieve high levels of efficiency <span class="No-Break">and responsiveness.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-20"><a id="_idTextAnchor019"/>Defining parallelism</h2>
			<p>Parallelism is the<a id="_idIndexMarker004"/> simultaneous execution of multiple tasks or calculations, typically on multi-core systems. In parallelism, each core handles a separate task concurrently, leveraging the principle of dividing large problems into smaller, independently solvable subtasks. This approach harnesses the power of multiple cores to achieve faster execution and efficient resource utilization. By assigning tasks to different cores, parallelism enables true simultaneous processing, as opposed to concurrency, which creates the illusion of simultaneous execution through time-sharing techniques. Parallelism requires hardware support in the form of multiple cores or processors to achieve optimal <span class="No-Break">performance gains.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-21"><a id="_idTextAnchor020"/>The analogy of a restaurant kitchen</h2>
			<p>Imagine a restaurant<a id="_idIndexMarker005"/> kitchen as a metaphor for a Java application. From this perspective, we will understand the role of concurrency and parallelism in <span class="No-Break">Java applications.</span></p>
			<p>First, we’ll consider concurrency. In a concurrent kitchen, there’s one chef (the main thread) who can handle multiple tasks such as chopping vegetables, grilling, and plating. They do one task at a time, switching between tasks (context switching). This is similar to a single-threaded Java application managing multiple <span class="No-Break">tasks asynchronously.</span></p>
			<p>Next, we come to parallelism. In a parallel kitchen, there are multiple chefs (multiple threads) working simultaneously, each handling a different task. This is like a Java application utilizing multi-threading to process different <span class="No-Break">tasks concurrently.</span></p>
			<p>The following is a Java code example <span class="No-Break">for concurrency:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
import java.util.concurrent.ExecutionExcept ion;
import java.util.concurrent.ExecutorService;
import java.util.concurrent.Executors;
import java.util.concurrent.Future;
public class ConcurrentKitchen {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    ExecutorService executor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(2);
    Future&lt;?&gt; task1 = executor.submit(() -&gt; {
        System.out.println("Chopping vegetables...");
        // Simulate task
        try {
            Thread.sleep(600);
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
        }
    });
    Future&lt;?&gt; task2 = executor.submit(() -&gt; {
        System.out.println("Grilling meat...");
        // Simulate task
        try {
            Thread.sleep(600);
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
        }
    });
    // Wait for both tasks to complete
    try {
        task1.get();
        task2.get();
    } catch (InterruptedException | ExecutionException e) {
        e.printStackTrace();
    }
    executor.shutdown();
  }
}</pre>			<p>Here is<a id="_idIndexMarker006"/> an explanation of the preceding <span class="No-Break">code example:</span></p>
			<ol>
				<li>We <a id="_idIndexMarker007"/>create a fixed thread pool with two threads using <strong class="source-inline">Executors.newFixedThreadPool(2)</strong>. This allows the tasks to be executed concurrently by utilizing <span class="No-Break">multiple threads.</span></li>
				<li>We submit two tasks to the executor using <strong class="source-inline">executor.submit()</strong>. These tasks are analogous to chopping vegetables and <span class="No-Break">grilling meat.</span></li>
				<li>After submitting the tasks, we use <strong class="source-inline">task1.get()</strong> and <strong class="source-inline">task2.get()</strong> to wait for both tasks to complete. The <strong class="source-inline">get()</strong> method blocks until the task is finished and returns the result (in this case, there is no result since the tasks have a void <span class="No-Break">return type).</span></li>
				<li>Finally, we shut down the executor using <strong class="source-inline">executor.shutdown()</strong> to release <span class="No-Break">the resources.</span></li>
			</ol>
			<p>Next, we will look at a Java code example <span class="No-Break">for parallelism:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
import java.util.stream.IntStream;
public class ParallelKitchen {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    IntStream.range(0, 10).parallel().forEach(i -&gt; {
        System.out.println("Cooking dish #" + i + " in parallel...");
        // Simulate task
        try {
            Thread.sleep(600);
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
        }
    });
  }
}</pre>			<p>Explanation<a id="_idIndexMarker008"/> of the preceding code example is <span class="No-Break">as follows.</span></p>
			<p>This Java code demonstrates parallel processing using <strong class="source-inline">IntStream</strong> and the parallel method, which is ideal for simulating tasks in a <strong class="source-inline">Parallel Kitchen</strong>. The main method utilizes an integer stream to create a range of <strong class="source-inline">0</strong> to <strong class="source-inline">9</strong>, representing a range of <span class="No-Break">different dishes.</span></p>
			<p>By invoking <strong class="source-inline">.parallel()</strong> on <strong class="source-inline">IntStream</strong>, the code ensures that the processing of these dishes happens in parallel, leveraging multiple threads. Each iteration simulates cooking a dish, identified by the index, <strong class="source-inline">i</strong>, and is executed concurrently with <span class="No-Break">other iterations.</span></p>
			<p>The <strong class="source-inline">Thread.sleep(600)</strong> inside the <strong class="source-inline">forEach</strong> lambda expression mimics the time taken to cook each dish. The sleep duration is set for simulation purposes and is not indicative of actual <span class="No-Break">cooking times.</span></p>
			<p>In the case of <strong class="source-inline">InterruptedException</strong>, the thread’s interrupt flag is set again with <strong class="source-inline">Thread.currentThread().interrupt()</strong>, adhering to best practices in handling interruptions <span class="No-Break">in Java.</span></p>
			<p>Having seen the two examples, let us understand the key differences between concurrency <span class="No-Break">and parallelism:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Focus</strong>: Concurrency is about managing multiple tasks, while parallelism is about executing tasks simultaneously for <span class="No-Break">performance gains</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Execution</strong>: Concurrency can work on single-core processors, but parallelism benefits from <span class="No-Break">multi-core systems</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>Both concurrency and parallelism play crucial roles in building efficient and responsive Java applications. The right approach for you depends on the specific needs of your program and the available <span class="No-Break">hardware re<a id="_idTextAnchor021"/>sources.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-22"><a id="_idTextAnchor022"/>When to use concurrency versus parallelism – a concise guide</h2>
			<p>Armed with the strengths of concurrency and parallelism, let’s dive into picking the perfect tool. We’ll weigh up complexity, environment, and task nature to ensure that your Java applications sing. Buckle up, master chefs, as we unlock optimal performance <span class="No-Break">and efficiency!</span></p>
			<h3>Con<a id="_idTextAnchor023"/>currency</h3>
			<p>Concurrency<a id="_idIndexMarker009"/> is essential for effectively managing multiple operations simultaneously, particularly in three <span class="No-Break">key areas:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Simultaneous task management</strong>: This<a id="_idIndexMarker010"/> is ideal for efficiently handling user requests and <strong class="bold">Input/Output (I/O)</strong> operations, especially <a id="_idIndexMarker011"/>with the use of non-blocking I/O. This technique allows programs to execute other tasks without waiting for data transfer to complete, significantly enhancing responsiveness <span class="No-Break">and throughput.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Resource sharing</strong>: Through<a id="_idIndexMarker012"/> synchronization tools such as locks, concurrency ensures safe access to shared resources among multiple threads, preserving data integrity and <span class="No-Break">preventing conflicts.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Scalability</strong>: Scalability<a id="_idIndexMarker013"/> is crucial in developing systems capable of expansion such as microservices in cloud environments. Concurrency facilitates the execution of numerous tasks across different servers or processes, improving the system’s overall performance and capacity to <span class="No-Break">handle growth.</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>Let’s look at some examples<a id="_idIndexMarker014"/> to illustrate each of the three key areas where concurrency <span class="No-Break">is essential.</span></p>
			<p>The first example is related to simultaneous task management. Here is a web server handling multiple client requests concurrently using <span class="No-Break">non-blocking I/O:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
import java.io.IOException;
import java.net.InetSocketAddress;
import java.nio.ByteBuffer;
import java.nio.channels.ServerSocketChannel;
import java.nio.channels.SocketChannel;
public class NonBlockingWebServer {
  public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {
    ServerSocketChannel serverSocket = ServerSocketChannel.open();
    serverSocket.bind(new InetSocketAddress(
        "localhost", 8080));
    serverSocket.configureBlocking(false);
    while (true) {
        SocketChannel clientSocket = serverSocket.accept();
        if (clientSocket != null) {
            clientSocket.configureBlocking(false);
            ByteBuffer buffer = ByteBuffer.allocate(1024);
            clientSocket.read(buffer);
            String request = new String(
                buffer.array()).trim();
            System.out.println(
                "Received request: " + request);
        // Process the request and send a response
            String response = "HTTP/1.1 200 OK\r\nContent-Length:                 12\r\n\r\nHello, World!";
            ByteBuffer responseBuffer = ByteBuffer.wrap(
                response.getBytes());
            clientSocket.write(responseBuffer);
            clientSocket.close();
        }
    }
}
}</pre>			<p>In this simplified example, the <a id="_idIndexMarker015"/><span class="No-Break">following happened:</span></p>
			<ol>
				<li>We created a <strong class="source-inline">ServerSocketChannel</strong> and bound it to a specific address <span class="No-Break">and port.</span></li>
				<li>We configured the server socket to be non-blocking <span class="No-Break">using </span><span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">configureBlocking(false)</strong></span><span class="No-Break">.</span></li>
				<li>Inside an infinite loop, we accepted incoming client connections using <strong class="source-inline">serverSocket.accept()</strong>. If a client is connected, we will proceed to handle <span class="No-Break">the request.</span></li>
				<li>We configured the client socket to be non-blocking <span class="No-Break">as well.</span></li>
				<li>We allocated a buffer to read the client request <span class="No-Break">using </span><span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">ByteBuffer.allocate()</strong></span><span class="No-Break">.</span></li>
				<li>We read the request from the client socket into the buffer <span class="No-Break">using </span><span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">clientSocket.read(buffer)</strong></span><span class="No-Break">.</span></li>
				<li>We processed the request and sent a response back to <span class="No-Break">the client.</span></li>
				<li>Finally, we closed the <span class="No-Break">client socket.</span></li>
			</ol>
			<p>This simplified example demonstrates the key concept of handling multiple client requests concurrently using non-blocking I/O. The server can accept and process requests from multiple clients without blocking, allowing for efficient utilization of system resources and <span class="No-Break">improved responsiveness.</span></p>
			<p>Note that this <a id="_idIndexMarker016"/>example has been simplified for illustration purposes and may not include all the necessary error handling and edge case considerations of a production-ready <span class="No-Break">web server.</span></p>
			<p>The second example is resource sharing. Here is an example of multiple threads accessing a shared counter <span class="No-Break">using synchronization:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
public class SynchronizedCounter {
    private int count = 0;
    public synchronized void increment() {
        count++;
    }
    public synchronized int getCount() {
        return count;
    }
}
public class CounterThread extends Thread {
    private SynchronizedCounter counter;
    public CounterThread(SynchronizedCounter counter) {
        this.counter = counter;
    }
    @Override
    public void run() {
        for (int i = 0; i &lt; 1000; i++) {
        counter.increment();
        }
    }
    public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException     {
        SynchronizedCounter counter = new SynchronizedCounter();
        CounterThread thread1 = new CounterThread(counter);
        CounterThread thread2 = new CounterThread(counter);
        thread1.start();
        thread2.start();
        thread1.join();
        thread2.join();
        System.out.println(
            "Final count: " + counter.getCount());
    }
}</pre>			<p>In this <a id="_idIndexMarker017"/>example, multiple (<strong class="source-inline">CounterThread</strong>) threads accessed a shared <strong class="source-inline">SynchronizedCounter</strong> object. The <strong class="source-inline">increment()</strong> and <strong class="source-inline">getCount()</strong> methods of the counter were synchronized to ensure that only one thread could access them at a time, preventing race conditions and maintaining <span class="No-Break">data integrity.</span></p>
			<p>Now, let us see an example of scalability. Here is a code example of microservice architecture using concurrency to handle a large number <span class="No-Break">of requests:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
import java.util.concurrent.ExecutorService;
import java.util.concurrent.Executors;
public class MicroserviceExample {
    private static final int NUM_THREADS = 10;
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ExecutorService executorService = Executors.        newFixedThreadPool(NUM_THREADS);
        for (int i = 0; i &lt; 100; i++) {
            executorService.submit(() -&gt; {
                // Simulate processing a request
                try {
                    Thread.sleep(1000);
                } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                      e.printStackTrace();
                }
        System.out.println("Request processed by " + Thread.        currentThread().getName());
            });
        }
        executorService.shutdown();
    }
}</pre>			<p>In this example, a <a id="_idIndexMarker018"/>microservice uses an <strong class="source-inline">ExecutorService</strong> with a fixed thread pool to handle a large number of requests concurrently. Each request is submitted as a task to the executor, which distributes them among the available threads. This allows the microservice to process multiple requests simultaneously, improving scalability and <span class="No-Break">overall performance.</span></p>
			<p>These examples demonstrate how concurrency is applied in different scenarios to achieve simultaneous task management, safe resource sharing, and scalability. They showcase the <a id="_idIndexMarker019"/>practical applications of concurrency in building efficient and <span class="No-Break">high-performing systems.</span></p>
			<h3>Parallelism</h3>
			<p>Parallelism<a id="_idIndexMarker020"/> is a powerful concept used to enhance computing efficiency across <span class="No-Break">various scenarios:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Compute-intensive tasks</strong>: It <a id="_idIndexMarker021"/>excels at deconstructing elaborate calculations into smaller, autonomous sub-tasks that can be executed in parallel. This method significantly streamlines complex <span class="No-Break">computational operations.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Performance optimization</strong>: By<a id="_idIndexMarker022"/> engaging multiple processor cores at once, parallelism substantially shortens the time needed to complete tasks. This simultaneous utilization of cores ensures a quicker, more efficient <span class="No-Break">execution process.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Large data processing</strong>: Parallelism is key in swiftly handling, analyzing, and modifying <a id="_idIndexMarker023"/>vast datasets. Its capability to process multiple data segments concurrently makes it invaluable for big data applications <span class="No-Break">and analytics.</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>Now let’s look at some short<a id="_idIndexMarker024"/> demo code examples to illustrate the concepts of parallelism in each of the <span class="No-Break">mentioned scenarios.</span></p>
			<p>First, let’s explore how parallelism can be applied to compute-intensive tasks, such as calculating Fibonacci numbers, using the <strong class="source-inline">Fork/Join</strong> framework <span class="No-Break">in Java:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
import java.util.Arrays;
import java.util.concurrent.ForkJoinPool;
import java.util.concurrent.RecursiveAction;
public class ParallelFibonacci extends RecursiveAction {
    private static final long THRESHOLD = 10;
    private final long n;
    public ParallelFibonacci(long n) {
        this.n = n;
    }
    @Override
    protected void compute() {
        if (n &lt;= THRESHOLD) {
        // Compute Fibonacci number sequentially
        int fib = fibonacci(n);
        System.out.println(
            "Fibonacci(" + n + ") = " + fib);
        } else {
        // Split the task into subtasks
        ParallelFibonacci leftTask = new ParallelFibonacci(
            n - 1);
        ParallelFibonacci rightTask = new ParallelFibonacci(n - 2);
        // Fork the subtasks for parallel execution
        leftTask.fork();
        rightTask.fork();
        // Join the results
        leftTask.join();
        rightTask.join();
        }
    }
    public static int fibonacci(long n) {
        if (n &lt;= 1)
        return (int) n;
        return fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2);
    }
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        long n = 40;
        ForkJoinPool pool = new ForkJoinPool();
        ParallelFibonacci task = new ParallelFibonacci(n);
        pool.invoke(task);
    }
}</pre>			<p>In this example, we <a id="_idIndexMarker025"/>used parallelism to compute the Fibonacci number of a given value <strong class="source-inline">n</strong>. The computation is split into subtasks using the <strong class="source-inline">Fork/Join</strong> framework. The <strong class="source-inline">ParallelFibonacci</strong> class extends <strong class="source-inline">RecursiveAction</strong> and overrides the <strong class="source-inline">compute()</strong> method. If the value of <strong class="source-inline">n</strong> is below a certain threshold, the Fibonacci number is computed sequentially. Otherwise, the task is split into two subtasks, which are forked for parallel execution. Finally, the results are joined to obtain the final <span class="No-Break">Fibonacci number.</span></p>
			<p>Next is performance optimization. Parallelism can significantly optimize performance, especially when dealing with time-consuming operations such as sorting large arrays. Let’s compare the performance of sequential and parallel sorting <span class="No-Break">in Java:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
import java.util.Arrays;
import java.util.Random;
public class ParallelArraySort {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] array = generateRandomArray(100000000);
        long start = System.currentTimeMillis();
        Arrays.sort(array);
        long end = System.currentTimeMillis();
        System.out.println("Sequential sorting took " + (
            end - start) + " ms");
        start = System.currentTimeMillis();
        Arrays.parallelSort(array);
        end = System.currentTimeMillis();
        System.out.println("Parallel sorting took " + (
            end - start) + " ms");
    }
    private static int[] generateRandomArray(int size) {
        int[] array = new int[size];
        Random random = new Random();
        for (int i = 0; i &lt; size; i++) {
            array[i] = random.nextInt();
        }
        return array;
    }
}</pre>			<p>In this example, we demonstrated the performance optimization achieved by using parallelism for sorting a large array. We generated a random array of size 100,000,000 and measured the time taken to sort the array using both sequential sorting (<strong class="source-inline">Arrays.sort()</strong>) and parallel sorting (<strong class="source-inline">Arrays.parallelSort()</strong>). Parallel sorting utilizes multiple processor cores to sort the array concurrently, resulting in faster execution compared to <span class="No-Break">sequential sorting.</span></p>
			<p>Now, let’s turn to<a id="_idIndexMarker026"/> large data processing. Processing large datasets can be greatly accelerated by leveraging parallelism. In this example, we’ll demonstrate how parallel streams in Java can efficiently calculate the sum of a large number <span class="No-Break">of elements:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;
public class ParallelDataProcessing {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        List&lt;Integer&gt; data = generateData(100000000);
        // Sequential processing
        long start = System.currentTimeMillis();
        int sum = data.stream().mapToInt(
            Integer::intValue).sum();
        long end = System.currentTimeMillis();
        System.out.println("Sequential sum: " + sum + ",
            time: " + (end - start) + " ms");
        // Parallel processing
        start = System.currentTimeMillis();
        sum = data.parallelStream().mapToInt(
            Integer::intValue).sum();
        end = System.currentTimeMillis();
        System.out.println("Parallel sum: " + sum + ",
            time: " + (end - start) + " ms");
    }
    private static List&lt;Integer&gt; generateData(int size) {
        List&lt;Integer&gt; data = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;(size);
        for (int i = 0; i &lt; size; i++) {
            data.add(i);
        }
        return data;
    }
}</pre>			<p>In this code, we<a id="_idIndexMarker027"/> generated a large list of 100,000,000 integers using the <strong class="source-inline">generateData</strong> method. We then calculated the sum of all elements using both sequential and <span class="No-Break">parallel streams.</span></p>
			<p>The sequential processing is performed using <strong class="source-inline">data.stream()</strong>, which creates a sequential stream from the data list. The <strong class="source-inline">mapToInt(Integer::intValue)</strong> operation converts each <strong class="source-inline">Integer</strong> object to its primitive <strong class="source-inline">int</strong> value, and the <strong class="source-inline">sum()</strong> method calculates the sum of all elements in <span class="No-Break">the stream.</span></p>
			<p>For parallel processing, we use <strong class="source-inline">data.parallelStream()</strong> to create a parallel stream. The parallel stream automatically splits the data into multiple chunks and processes them concurrently using available processor cores. The same <strong class="source-inline">mapToInt(Integer::intValue)</strong> and <strong class="source-inline">sum()</strong> operations are applied to calculate the sum of all elements <span class="No-Break">in parallel.</span></p>
			<p>We measure the execution time of both sequential and parallel processing using <strong class="source-inline">System.currentTimeMillis()</strong> before and after each operation. By comparing the execution times, we <a id="_idIndexMarker028"/>can observe the performance improvement achieved by <span class="No-Break">using parallelism.</span></p>
			<h3>Choosing the right approach</h3>
			<p>So, you’ve mastered the power of both concurrency<a id="_idIndexMarker029"/> and parallelism. Now comes the key <a id="_idIndexMarker030"/>question: how do you choose the right tool for the job? It’s a dance between performance gains and complexity, where environment and task characteristics play their part. Let’s dive into this crucial <span class="No-Break">decision-making process:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Complexity versus benefit</strong>: Weigh the performance gain of parallelism against its increased complexity and potential <span class="No-Break">debugging challenges</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Environment</strong>: Consider your cloud infrastructure’s capability for parallel processing (number of <span class="No-Break">available cores)</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Task nature and dependencies</strong>: Independent, CPU-intensive tasks favor parallelism, while tasks with shared resources or I/O operations may benefit <span class="No-Break">from concurrency</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>We’ve just equipped you with the culinary secrets of concurrency and parallelism, the dynamic duo that powers efficient Java applications. Remember, concurrency juggles multiple tasks like a master chef, while parallelism unleashes the power of multi-core machines for <span class="No-Break">lightning-fast performance.</span></p>
			<p>Why is this culinary wisdom so crucial? In the cloud-native world, Java shines as a versatile chef, adapting to diverse tasks. Concurrency and parallelism become your essential tools, ensuring responsiveness to user requests, handling complex calculations, and processing massive data – all on the ever-evolving canvas of <span class="No-Break">the cloud.</span></p>
			<p>Now let’s take this culinary expertise to the next level. In the next section, we’ll explore how these concurrency and parallelism skills seamlessly blend with cloud technologies to build truly scalable and high-performance Java applications. So sharpen your knives and get ready to conquer the <span class="No-Break">cloud-native kitchen!</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-23"><a id="_idTextAnchor024"/>Java and the cloud – a perfect alliance for cloud-native development</h1>
			<p>Java’s journey with cloud computing is a testament to its adaptability and innovation. The fusion of their capabilities has created a powerful alliance for cloud-native development. Imagine yourself as an architect, wielding Java’s toolkit at the forefront of cloud technology. Here, Java’s versatility and robustness partner with the cloud’s agility and scalability to offer a canvas for innovation and growth. We’re not just discussing theoretical concepts – we’re stepping into a realm where Java’s pragmatic application in the cloud has revolutionized development, deployment, and application management. Let’s uncover how Java in the cloud era is not just an option, but a strategic choice for developers seeking to unlock the full potentia<a id="_idTextAnchor025"/>l of <span class="No-Break">cloud-native development.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-24"><a id="_idTextAnchor026"/>Exploring cloud service models and their impact on software development</h2>
			<p>Java development has entered a new era with cloud computing. Imagine having instant access to a vast pool of virtual resources, from servers to storage to networking. Cloud services unlock this magic, empowering Java developers to build and scale applications faster and <span class="No-Break">more efficiently.</span></p>
			<p>Three distinct service models dominate the cloud, each impacting development needs and Java application architecture. Let us explore each one <span class="No-Break">of them.</span></p>
			<h3>Infrastructure as a service</h3>
			<p><strong class="bold">Infrastructure as a Service</strong> (<strong class="bold">IaaS</strong>) offers<a id="_idIndexMarker031"/> foundational cloud computing<a id="_idIndexMarker032"/> resources such as virtual machines and storage. For Java developers, this means complete control over the operating environment, allowing for customized Java application setups and optimizations. However, it requires a deeper understanding of <span class="No-Break">infrastructure management.</span></p>
			<h4>Code example – Java on IaaS (Amazon EC2)</h4>
			<p>This code snippet<a id="_idIndexMarker033"/> showcases how to create and launch an Amazon <strong class="bold">Elastic Compute Cloud</strong> (<strong class="bold">EC2</strong>) instance<a id="_idIndexMarker034"/> using the AWS SDK <span class="No-Break">for Java:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
// Create EC2 client
AmazonEC2Client ec2Client = new AmazonEC2Client();
// Configure instance details
RunInstancesRequest runRequest = new RunInstancesRequest();
runRequest.setImageId("ami-98760987");
runRequest.setInstanceType("t2.micro");
runRequest.setMinCount(1);
runRequest.setMaxCount(3);
// Launch instance
RunInstancesResult runResult = ec2Client.runInstances(runRequest);
// Get instance ID
String instanceId = runResult.getReservations().get(0).getInstances().get(0).getInstanceId();
// ... Configure Tomcat installation and web application deployment ...</pre>			<p>Let’s break it down step <span class="No-Break">by step:</span></p>
			<ol>
				<li><strong class="bold">Create the </strong><span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">EC2 </strong></span><span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">client</strong></span><span class="No-Break">:</span><ul><li><strong class="source-inline">// Create </strong><span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">EC2 client</strong></span></li><li><strong class="source-inline">AmazonEC2Client ec2Client = </strong><span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">new AmazonEC2Client();</strong></span></li></ul></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Configure the details</strong>: Configure <a id="_idIndexMarker035"/>the details of the instance we want to launch. This includes <span class="No-Break">the following:</span><ul><li><strong class="source-inline">setImageId</strong>: The <strong class="bold">Amazon Machine Image (AMI)</strong> ID<a id="_idIndexMarker036"/> specifies the pre-configured operating system and software stack for <span class="No-Break">the instance</span></li><li><strong class="source-inline">setInstanceType</strong>: We define the instance type, such as <strong class="source-inline">t2.micro</strong>, for a small, <span class="No-Break">cost-effective option</span></li><li><strong class="source-inline">setMinCount</strong>: We specify the minimum number of instances to launch (<strong class="source-inline">1</strong> in <span class="No-Break">this case)</span></li><li><strong class="source-inline">setMaxCount</strong>: We specify the maximum number of instances to launch (<strong class="source-inline">3</strong> in this case, allowing the system to scale up <span class="No-Break">if needed)</span></li></ul></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Launch the instance</strong>: We call the <strong class="source-inline">runInstances</strong> method on the <strong class="source-inline">ec2Client</strong> object, passing the configured <strong class="source-inline">runRequest</strong> object. This sends the request to AWS to launch the desired <span class="No-Break">EC2 instances.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Get instance ID</strong>: The <strong class="source-inline">runInstances</strong> method returns a <strong class="source-inline">RunInstancesResult</strong> object containing information about the launched instances. We will extract the instance ID of the first instance (assuming a successful launch) for further use in the <span class="No-Break">deployment process.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Configure Tomcat and deploy application</strong>: This comment indicates that the next steps will involve setting up Tomcat on the launched EC2 instance and deploying your web application. The specific code for this would depend on your chosen Tomcat installation method and application <span class="No-Break">deployment strategy.</span></li>
			</ol>
			<p>This example <a id="_idIndexMarker037"/>demonstrates launching instances with a minimum and maximum count. You can adjust these values based on your desired level of redundancy <span class="No-Break">and scalability.</span></p>
			<h3>Platform as a service</h3>
			<p><strong class="bold">Platform as a Service</strong> (<strong class="bold">PaaS</strong>) provides a higher-level environment with ready-to-use platforms including operating systems <a id="_idIndexMarker038"/>and development tools. This is <a id="_idIndexMarker039"/>beneficial for Java developers as it simplifies deployment and management, though it might limit <span class="No-Break">lower-level control.</span></p>
			<h4>Code example – Java on AWS Lambda</h4>
			<p>This code <a id="_idIndexMarker040"/>snippet defines a simple Java Lambda function that processes an S3 object <span class="No-Break">upload event:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
public class S3ObjectProcessor implements RequestHandler&lt;S3Event, String&gt; {
    @Override
    public String handleRequest(S3Event event,
        Context context) {
            for (S3Record record : event.getRecords()) {
            String bucketName = record.getS3().getBucket().getName();
            String objectKey = record.getS3().getObject().getKey();
            // ...process uploaded object ...
        }
    return "Processing complete";
    }
}</pre>			<p>This code is a listener for Amazon S3 object uploads. It’s like a robot that watches for new files in a specific bucket (such as a folder) and automatically does something with them when <span class="No-Break">they arrive:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li>It checks for new files in the bucket: for each new file, it gets the filename and the bucket <span class="No-Break">it’s in</span></li>
				<li>You need to fill in the missing part: write your own code here to say what you want the robot to do with the file (e.g., download it, analyze it, or send <span class="No-Break">an email)</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>Once the robot<a id="_idIndexMarker041"/> finishes with all the files, it sends a message back to Amazon saying <span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">Processing complete</strong></span><span class="No-Break">.</span></p>
			<p>I hope this simplified explanation makes <span class="No-Break">things clearer!</span></p>
			<h3>Software as a service</h3>
			<p><strong class="bold">Software as a service</strong> (<strong class="bold">SaaS</strong>) delivers <a id="_idIndexMarker042"/>complete application functionality as a<a id="_idIndexMarker043"/> service. For Java developers, this often means focusing on building the application’s business logic without worrying about the deployment environment. However, customization and control over the platform <span class="No-Break">are limited.</span></p>
			<h4>Code example – Java on SaaS (AWS Lambda)</h4>
			<p>This code snippet<a id="_idIndexMarker044"/> defines a Lambda function for processing <span class="No-Break">event data:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
public class LambdaHandler {
    public String handleRequest(Map&lt;String, Object&gt; event,
        Context context) {
        // Get data from event
        String message = (String) event.get("message");
        // Process data
        String result = "Processed message: " + message;
        // Return result
        return result;
    }
}</pre>			<p>This code defines a<a id="_idIndexMarker045"/> class called <strong class="source-inline">LambdaHandler</strong> that listens for events in a serverless environment such as AWS Lambda. Here’s <span class="No-Break">a breakdown:</span></p>
			<ol>
				<li>Listening <span class="No-Break">for events:</span><ul><li>The class is named <strong class="source-inline">LambdaHandler</strong>, signifying its role as a handler for <span class="No-Break">Lambda events.</span></li><li>The <strong class="source-inline">handleRequest</strong> method is the entry point for processing <span class="No-Break">incoming events.</span></li><li>The event parameter holds the data received from the <span class="No-Break">Lambda invocation.</span></li></ul></li>
				<li><span class="No-Break">Processing data:</span><ul><li>Inside the <strong class="source-inline">handleRequest</strong> method, the code retrieves the message key from the event data <span class="No-Break">using </span><span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">event.get("message")</strong></span><span class="No-Break">.</span></li><li>This assumes that the event format includes a key named <strong class="source-inline">message</strong> containing the actual data to <span class="No-Break">be processed.</span></li><li>The code then processes the message and combines it with a prefix to generate a new string stored in the <span class="No-Break">result variable.</span></li></ul></li>
				<li><span class="No-Break">Returning result:</span><ul><li>Finally, the <strong class="source-inline">handleRequest</strong> method returns the processed message stored in the result variable. This is the response that is sent back to the caller of the <span class="No-Break">Lambda function.</span></li></ul></li>
			</ol>
			<p>In simpler terms, this code acts like a small service that takes in data (messages) through an event, processes it (adds a prefix), and returns the updated version. It’s a simple example of how Lambda functions can handle basic data processing tasks in a <span class="No-Break">serverless environment.</span></p>
			<p>Understanding the strengths and weaknesses of each cloud service model is crucial for Java developers to be able to make the best decisions for their projects. By choosing the right model, they can unlock the immense potential of cloud computing and revolutionize the way in which they build and deploy <span class="No-Break">Java applications.</span></p>

			<p>But the cloud journey isn’t without its challenges. Security, cost optimization, and efficient resource management all come knocking at the door of your cloud-native development. In the next section, we’ll dive deep into these modern challenges, equipping you with the knowledge and tools to navigate them like a seasoned cloud explorer. So buckle up, fellow Java adventurers, as we venture into the exciting realm of modern challenges in <span class="No-Break">cloud-native development!</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-29"><a id="_idTextAnchor034"/>Modern challenges in cloud-native concurrency and Java’s weapons of choice</h1>
			<p>The cloud’s concurrency challenges loom, but Java’s not backing down. We’ll tackle these challenges in transactions, data consistency, and microservices states, all while wielding tools such as Akka, Vert.x, and reactive programming. Choose your weapons wisely, for the cloud-native concurrency challenge is yours <span class="No-Break">to conquer!</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-30"><a id="_idTextAnchor035"/>Wrangling distributed transactions in Java – beyond classic commits</h2>
			<p>In the wild jungle of <a id="_idIndexMarker087"/>distributed systems, managing transactions across services and databases can be a daunting task. Traditional methods stumble over network delays, partial failures, and diverse systems. But fear not, Java warriors! We’ve got your back with a robust arsenal <span class="No-Break">of solutions:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Two-phase commit (2PC)</strong>: This classic protocol ensures all parties in a transaction commit or roll back together. While not ideal for high-speed environments due to its blocking nature, 2PC remains a reliable option for more <span class="No-Break">controlled transactions.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Saga pattern</strong>: Think of this as a choreographed dance, where each local transaction is linked to others through a sequence of events. Java frameworks such as Axon and Eventuate help you orchestrate this graceful ballet, ensuring data consistency even when things <span class="No-Break">get messy.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Compensating transactions</strong>: Imagine a safety net for your saga. If a step goes wrong, compensating transactions swoop in, reversing the effects of previous operations and keeping your data safe. Java services can implement this strategy with service compensations, which are ready to clean up <span class="No-Break">any spills.</span></li>
			</ul>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-31"><a id="_idTextAnchor036"/>Maintaining data consistency in cloud-native Java applications</h2>
			<p>Data consistency in the cloud can be a <a id="_idIndexMarker088"/>tricky tango, especially with NoSQL’s eventual rhythm. But Java’s got the notes to keep <span class="No-Break">it harmonious:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Kafka’s eventual beat</strong>: Updates become rhythmic pulses, sent out and listened to by services. It’s not immediate, but everyone eventually grooves to the <span class="No-Break">same tune.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Caching whispers</strong>: Tools such as Hazelcast<a id="_idIndexMarker089"/> and Ignite<a id="_idIndexMarker090"/> act as quick assistants, keeping data consistent across nodes, even when the main database takes <span class="No-Break">a break.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Entity versioning</strong>: When two updates waltz in at once, versioning helps us track who came first and<a id="_idIndexMarker091"/> resolve conflicts gracefully. No data mosh <span class="No-Break">pits here!</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>With these moves and a bit of Java magic, your cloud applications will keep your data safe and sound, moving in <span class="No-Break">perfect rhythm.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-32"><a id="_idTextAnchor037"/>Handling state in microservices architectures</h2>
			<p>Microservices are a beautiful dance of<a id="_idIndexMarker092"/> independent services, but what about their state? Managing it across this distributed landscape can feel like wrangling a herd of wild cats. But fear not, Java offers a map and a torch to guide <span class="No-Break">you through:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Stateless serenity</strong>: When possible, design microservices as stateless citizens of the cloud. This keeps them lightweight, scalable, and <span class="No-Break">effortlessly resilient.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Distributed session sherpas</strong>: For those services that crave a bit of state, distributed session management tools such as Redis and ZooKeeper come to the rescue. They keep track of state across nodes, ensuring everyone’s on the <span class="No-Break">same page.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">CQRS and event sourcing – the stateful waltz</strong>: For truly complex state dances, patterns such as <strong class="bold">Command Query Responsibility Segregation</strong> (<strong class="bold">CQRS</strong>) and <a id="_idIndexMarker093"/>Event Sourcing offer a graceful solution. Java frameworks such as Axon provide the perfect shoes for this <span class="No-Break">intricate choreography.</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>With these strategies in your arsenal, you can navigate the stateful microservices maze with confidence, building resilient and scalable systems that thrive in the ever-changing <span class="No-Break">cloud landscape.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-33"><a id="_idTextAnchor038"/>Cloud database concurrency – Java’s dance moves for shared resources</h2>
			<p>Imagine a crowded dance <a id="_idIndexMarker094"/>floor – that’s your cloud database with multiple clients vying for attention. It’s a delicate tango of multi-tenancy and resource sharing. Keeping everyone in step requires some <span class="No-Break">fancy footwork.</span></p>
			<p>The <strong class="bold">Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability</strong> (<strong class="bold">ACID</strong>) test<a id="_idIndexMarker095"/> adds another layer of complexity. Messy concurrency can easily trip up data integrity, especially in distributed environments. Java’s got your back with a few fancy <span class="No-Break">footwork moves:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Sharing (with manners)</strong>: Multi-tenancy and resource sharing are no problem with Java’s locking mechanisms, which include synchronized blocks and ReentrantLock. They act as bouncers, ensuring everyone gets their turn without stepping on toes (<span class="No-Break">or data).</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Optimistic versus pessimistic locking</strong>: Think of these as different dance styles. Optimistic locking assumes that everyone plays nice, while pessimistic locking keeps a watchful eye, preventing conflicts before they happen. Java frameworks such as JPA and Hibernate offer both styles, letting you choose the <span class="No-Break">perfect rhythm.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Caching the craze</strong>: Frequently accessed data gets its own VIP lounge: the distributed cache. Java solutions such as Hazelcast and Apache Ignite keep this lounge stocked, reducing database load and ensuring smooth data access <span class="No-Break">for everyone.</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>With these moves in your repertoire, your Java applications can waltz gracefully through cloud database concurrency, ensuring data consistency and smooth performance even when the dance floor <span class="No-Break">gets crowded.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-34"><a id="_idTextAnchor039"/>Parallelism in big data processing frameworks</h2>
			<p>Imagine waves of data, rushing <a id="_idIndexMarker096"/>in like a flood. You need a way to analyze it all – fast. That’s where parallel processing comes in, and Java’s got the tools to <span class="No-Break">tackle it:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">MapReduce</strong>: Java is extensively used in MapReduce<a id="_idIndexMarker097"/> programming models, as seen in Hadoop. Developers write Map and Reduce functions in Java to process large datasets in parallel across a <span class="No-Break">Hadoop cluster.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Apache Spark</strong>: Although it is<a id="_idIndexMarker098"/> written in Scala, Spark provides Java APIs. It enables parallel data processing by distributing data across <strong class="bold">Resilient Distributed Datasets</strong> (<strong class="bold">RDDs</strong>) and <a id="_idIndexMarker099"/>executing operations <span class="No-Break">in parallel.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Stream processing</strong>: Java Stream API, along <a id="_idIndexMarker100"/>with tools such as<a id="_idIndexMarker101"/> Apache Flink and <a id="_idIndexMarker102"/>Apache Storm, supports<a id="_idIndexMarker103"/> parallel stream processing<a id="_idIndexMarker104"/> for real-time <span class="No-Break">data analytics.</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>So, when data gets overwhelming, remember Java. It’s got the tools to keep you informed and in control, even when the <span class="No-Break">beast roars!</span></p>
			<p>Here, we will kick off the thrilling journey into concurrency and parallelism in the cloud-native Java world. Get ready to transform these challenges into opportunities. In the pages ahead, you’ll acquire the tools to master concurrency and parallelism. This will empower you to build robust, future-proof Java applications that thrive in <span class="No-Break">the cloud.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-35"><a id="_idTextAnchor040"/>Cutting-edge tools for conquering cloud-native concurrency c<a id="_idTextAnchor041"/>hallenges</h2>

Consul’s web UI and rich API make it easy to manage and monitor <span class="No-Break">distributed systems.</span></li>
			</ul>
			<h3>Modern asynchronous programming patterns</h3>
			<p>These modern asynchronous patterns enable efficient non-blocking data processing and scalable, <span class="No-Break">resilient applications:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Reactive Streams</strong>: This <a id="_idIndexMarker117"/>specification provides a standard way to write asynchronous, non-blocking programs.

				<li><strong class="bold">Coordination needs</strong>: ZooKeeper is well-suited for basic coordination tasks, while etcd’s key-value store offers additional flexibility. Consul provides a complete service <span class="No-Break">mesh solution.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Programming style</strong>: Reactive Streams requires a shift in thinking toward asynchronous programming, while asynchronous messaging can be integrated with traditional <span class="No-Break">synchronous approaches.</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>By understanding the available solutions and their trade-offs, developers can choose the right tools and techniques to address specific concurrency challenges in their cloud-native applications. This, in turn, leads to building more scalable, responsive, and resilient systems that thrive in the dynamic <span class="No-Break">cloud environment.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-36"><a id="_idTextAnchor042"/>Conquering concurrency – best practices for robust cloud-native applications</h1>

			</ul>
			<p>With a solid understanding of best practices, let's turn our attention <span class="No-Break">to code.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-37"><a id="_idTextAnchor043"/>Code examples illustrating best practices</h2>
			<p>Let’s look at some <span class="No-Break">code examples.</span></p>
			<h3>Asynchronous programming with reactive streams</h3>
			<p>We can leverage reactive <a id="_idIndexMarker124"/>streams such as RxJava to implement an asynchronous processing pipeline. This allows for the concurrent execution of independent tasks, improving responsiveness and throughput. Here is a code example using <span class="No-Break">reactive streams:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
// Define a service interface for processing requests
public interface UserService {
    Mono&lt;User&gt; getUserById(String userId);
}
// Implement the service using reactive streams
public class UserServiceImpl implements UserService {
    @Override
    public Mono&lt;User&gt; getUserById(String userId) {
        return Mono.fromCallable(() -&gt; {
        // Simulate fetching user data from a database
           Thread.sleep(600);
           return new User(userId, "Jack Smith");
        });
    }
}
// Example usage
Mono&lt;User&gt; userMono = userService.getUserById("99888");
userMono.subscribe(user -&gt; {
    // Process user data
    System.out.println("User: " + user.getName());
});</pre>			<p>This code defines <a id="_idIndexMarker125"/>a service for handling user requests in a reactive way. Think of it as a waiter at a restaurant who takes your order (user ID) and brings back your food (<span class="No-Break">user information).</span></p>
			<p>The following are the key points to be noted from the <span class="No-Break">preceding code:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Interface</strong>: <strong class="source-inline">UserService</strong> defines the service contract, promising to get a user <span class="No-Break">by ID.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Implementation</strong>: <strong class="source-inline">UserServiceImpl</strong> provides the actual logic for fetching <span class="No-Break">the user.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Reactive</strong>: It uses <strong class="source-inline">Mono</strong> from reactive streams, meaning the user data is delivered asynchronously, like a waiter who tells you your food is <span class="No-Break">coming later.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Fetching data</strong>: The code simulates fetching user data (sleeping for <strong class="source-inline">600</strong> milliseconds) and then returns a <strong class="source-inline">User</strong> object with the ID <span class="No-Break">and name.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Usage</strong>: You call <strong class="source-inline">getUserById</strong> with a user ID, and it returns <strong class="source-inline">Mono</strong> containing the user data. You can then <strong class="source-inline">subscribe</strong> to <strong class="source-inline">Mono</strong> to receive the user information <a id="_idIndexMarker126"/>later when <span class="No-Break">it’s ready.</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>In short, this code shows how to define and implement a reactive service in Java using an interface and <strong class="source-inline">Mono</strong> to handle asynchronous <span class="No-Break">data retrieval.</span></p>
			<h3>Cloud-native concurrency frameworks</h3>
			<p>Akka is a popular cloud-native <a id="_idIndexMarker127"/>concurrency framework that provides powerful tools for building highly scalable and resilient applications. It offers features such as actor-based message passing, fault tolerance, and resource management. Here is an example of handling user <span class="No-Break">requests asynchronously:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
public class UserActor extends AbstractActor {
  public static Props props() {
        return Props.create(UserActor.class);
    }
    @Override
    public Receive createReceive() {
        return receiveBuilder()
            .match(GetUserRequest.class, this::handleGetUserRequest)
            .build();
    }
    private void handleGetUserRequest(GetUserRequest request) throws     InterruptedException {
        // Simulate fetching user data
        Thread.sleep(600);
        User user = new User(request.getUserId(), "Jack Smith");
        getSender().tell(new GetUserResponse(user), getSelf());
    }
}
// Example usage
public class ActorManager {
    private ActorSystem system;
    private ActorRef userActor;
    private ActorRef printActor;
    public ActorManager() {
        system = ActorSystem.create("my-system");
        userActor = system.actorOf(UserActor.props(), "user-actor");
        printActor = system.actorOf(PrintActor.props(), "print-        actor");
    }
    public void start() {
        // Send request to UserActor and expect PrintActor to handle         the response
        userActor.tell(new GetUserRequest("9986"), printActor);
    }
    public void shutdown() {
        system.terminate();
    }
    public static void runActorSystem() {
        ActorManager manager = new ActorManager();
        manager.start();
        // Ensure system doesn't shutdown immediately
        try {
            // Wait some time before shutdown to ensure the response             is processed
            Thread.sleep(5000);
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
        }
        manager.shutdown();
    }
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Start the actor system
        runActorSystem();
    }
}</pre>			<p>In the example provided, <strong class="source-inline">UserActor</strong> class in Akka defines an actor that handles user requests asynchronously. The class provides a static <strong class="source-inline">props()</strong> method for actor instantiation, encapsulating its creation logic. In the <strong class="source-inline">createReceive()</strong> method, the actor defines its behavior by using the <strong class="source-inline">receiveBuilder()</strong> to match messages of type <strong class="source-inline">GetUserRequest</strong>. When such a message is received, it delegates the handling to the private <span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">handleGetUserRequest()</strong></span><span class="No-Break"> method.</span></p>
			<p>The <strong class="source-inline">handleGetUserRequest()</strong> method simulates a delay of 600 milliseconds to represent fetching user data. After the delay, it creates a <strong class="source-inline">User</strong> object with the provided user ID and a hardcoded name <strong class="source-inline">"Jack Smith"</strong>. The actor then sends a <strong class="source-inline">GetUserResponse</strong> message containing the <strong class="source-inline">User</strong> object back to the sender using <strong class="source-inline">getSender()</strong> and <strong class="source-inline">getSelf()</strong>. This design ensures that each request is processed independently, allowing the system to handle multiple concurrent <span class="No-Break">requests efficiently.</span></p>
			<p>In short, this code uses an actor model to handle user requests asynchronously. The actor receives tasks, works on them, and sends back results, making your application more responsive <span class="No-Break">and efficient.</span></p>
			<h3>Distributed coordination with ZooKeeper</h3>
			<p>Imagine that our application<a id="_idIndexMarker128"/> now scales to multiple nodes. To maintain a consistent state across the nodes and prevent conflicts, we can utilize a distributed coordination tool such as ZooKeeper. The following is an example of <span class="No-Break">using ZooKeeper:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
// Connect to ZooKeeper server
CuratorFramework zkClient = CuratorFrameworkFactory.newClient(zkConnectionString);
zkClient.start();
// Create a persistent node to store the latest processed request ID
String zkNodePath = "/processed-requests";
zkClient.create().creatingParentsIfNeeded().forPath(zkNodePath);
// Implement request processing logic
public void processRequest(String requestId) {
 // Check if the request has already been processed
 if (zkClient.checkExists().forPath(zkNodePath + "/" + requestId) !=  null) {
    System.out.println("Request already processed: " + requestId);
    return;
}
 // Process the request
 // ...
 // Mark the request as processed in ZooKeeper
 zkClient.create().forPath(zkNodePath + "/" + requestId);
}</pre>			<p>This code snippet <a id="_idIndexMarker129"/>sets up a simple system to track processed requests using ZooKeeper, a distributed coordination service. Here’s <span class="No-Break">a breakdown:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Connect and create a node</strong>: It connects to ZooKeeper and creates a persistent node called <strong class="source-inline">/processed-requests</strong> to store processed <span class="No-Break">request IDs.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Check for existing requests</strong>: Before processing a new request (identified by <strong class="source-inline">requestId</strong>), the code checks whether a node with that ID already exists under the <span class="No-Break">called/processed-requests node.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Process and mark</strong>: If the request hasn’t been processed before, the actual processing logic is executed. Then, a new node with <strong class="source-inline">requestId</strong> is created under the called or processed-requests to mark it <span class="No-Break">as processed.</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>Think of it like a checklist in ZooKeeper. Each request has its own checkbox. Checking it means it’s been dealt with. This ensures that requests are not processed multiple times, even if the connection drops or the <span class="No-Break">server restarts.</span></p>
			<p>By integrating these best practices into your development process, you can build cloud-native applications that are not only highly functional but also robust and resilient to the complexities of concurrency. Remember, embracing concurrency-first design is not just about solving immediate problems. It’s also about building a foundation for future scalability and sustainable growth in the dynamic <span class="No-Break">cloud environment.</span></p>

			<p>Concurrency in cloud-native Java applications <a id="_idIndexMarker135"/>introduces unique testing challenges. To ensure robust and resilient applications, address these <a id="_idIndexMarker136"/>challenges head-on with targeted <span class="No-Break">testing strategies:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Concurrency-focused unit testing</strong>: Use unit tests to isolate and examine the behavior of individual components under concurrent scenarios. This includes testing for thread safety and handling of <span class="No-Break">shared resources.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Integration testing for distributed interactions</strong>: Conduct integration tests to ensure that different components interact correctly under concurrent conditions, especially in microservices architectures common in <span class="No-Break">cloud environments.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Performance and stress testing</strong>: Stress test your application under high load to uncover issues such as deadlocks or livelocks that only emerge under specific conditions or heavy <span class="No-Break">concurrent access.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Automated testing for efficiency</strong>: Implement automated tests using frameworks such as JUnit, focusing on scenarios that mimic concurrent operations. Use mock testing frameworks to simulate complex concurrency scenarios <span class="No-Break">and dependencies.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Concurrency testing tools</strong>: Leverage tools such as JMeter, Gatling, Locust, or Tsung to test how your application handles high concurrent loads. This helps you identify performance bottlenecks and scalability issues in <span class="No-Break">cloud-native environments.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Ongoing commitment</strong>: Maintaining consistent concurrency strategies is an ongoing commitment. Regularly review and revise your approach as your application evolves and new libraries, frameworks, and best practices emerge. By fostering a culture of consistency and continuous improvement, you can build reliable, scalable, and performant cloud-native applications that thrive in the ever-changing <span class="No-Break">digital landscape.</span></li>

			<h1 id="_idParaDest-39"><a id="_idTextAnchor045"/>Summary</h1>
			<p><a href="B20937_01.xhtml#_idTextAnchor014"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 1</em></span></a> introduced the fundamental concepts of Java cloud-native development, focusing on concurrency and parallelism. It distinguished between managing tasks on single-core (concurrency) versus multi-core processors (parallelism), with practical Java examples. The chapter highlighted Java’s role in cloud computing, emphasizing its scalability, ecosystem, and community. Practical applications, including the Java AWS SDK and Lambda functions, illustrated Java’s adaptability across <span class="No-Break">cloud models.</span></p>
			<p>Significant Java updates such as Project Loom and advanced garbage collection methods were discussed for optimizing performance. Java’s effectiveness in complex environments was showcased through case studies of Netflix and X (formerly Twitter), among others. These focused on microservices, real-time data processing, <span class="No-Break">and scalability.</span></p>
			<p>The narrative then shifted to practical strategies for distributed transactions, data consistency, and microservices state management. The chapter advocated for consistent concurrency strategies in cloud-native applications. It concluded with resources for further exploration and tools for mastering Java concurrency and parallelism, equipping developers to build scalable cloud-native applications. The foundation that has been set here will lead to deeper explorations of Java’s concurrency mechanisms in <span class="No-Break">subsequent chapters.</span></p>
			<p>Next, we will transition to a new chapter that delves into the foundational principles of concurrency within the <span class="No-Break">Java ecosystem.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-40"><a id="_idTextAnchor046"/>Exercise – exploring Java executors</h1>
			<p><strong class="bold">Objective</strong>: In this exercise, you will explore different types of executors provided by the Java Concurrency API. You will refer to the Java documentation, use a different executor implementation, and observe its behavior in a <span class="No-Break">sample program.</span></p>
			<p><span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">Instructions</strong></span><span class="No-Break">:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li>Visit the Java documentation for the <strong class="source-inline">Executors</strong> <span class="No-Break">class: </span><a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/Executors.html"><span class="No-Break">https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/Executors.html</span></a><span class="No-Break">.</span></li>
				<li>Read through the documentation and familiarize yourself with the different factory methods provided by the <strong class="source-inline">Executors</strong> class for creating <span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">Executor</strong></span><span class="No-Break"> instances.</span></li>
				<li>Choose a different executor implementation other than the fixed thread pool used in the previous examples. Some options include <span class="No-Break">the following:</span><ul><li><span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">Executors.newCachedThreadPool()</strong></span></li><li><span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">Executors.newSingleThreadExecutor()</strong></span></li><li><span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">Executors.newScheduledThreadPool(int corePoolSize)</strong></span></li></ul></li>
				<li>Create a new Java class called <strong class="source-inline">ExecutorExploration</strong> and replace the Executor creation line with the chosen executor implementation. For example, if you chose <strong class="source-inline">Executors.newCachedThreadPool()</strong>, your code would look like this:Top <span class="No-Break">of Form</span><pre class="source-code">
ExecutorService executor = Executors.newCachedThreadPool();</pre></li>				<li>Modify the task creation and submission logic to create and submit a larger number of tasks (e.g., 100 tasks) to the executor. Here’s an example of how you can modify the code to create and submit 100 tasks to <span class="No-Break">the executor:</span><pre class="source-code">
public class ExecutorExploration {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ExecutorService executor = Executors.        newCachedThreadPool();
        // Create and submit 100 tasks to the Executor
        for (int i = 0; i &lt; 100; i++) {
            int taskId = i;
            executor.submit(() -&gt; {
                System.out.println("Task " + taskId + " executed                 by " + Thread.currentThread().getName());
                // Simulating task execution time
                try {
                Thread.sleep(1000);
                } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                e.printStackTrace();
            }
        });
    }
    // Shutdown the Executor
    executor.shutdown();
    }
}</pre></li>				<li>Run the program and observe the behavior of the chosen executor. Take note of how it handles the submitted tasks and any differences compared to the fixed <span class="No-Break">thread pool.</span></li>
				<li>Experiment with different executor implementations and observe how they behave differently in terms of task execution, thread creation, and <span class="No-Break">resource utilization.</span></li>
				<li>Consider the <span class="No-Break">following questions:</span><ul><li>How does the chosen executor handle the submitted tasks compared to the fixed <span class="No-Break">thread pool?</span></li><li>Are there any differences in the order or concurrency of <span class="No-Break">task execution?</span></li><li>How does the executor manage threads and <span class="No-Break">resource allocation?</span></li></ul></li>
				<li>Feel free to refer back to the Java documentation to understand the characteristics and use cases of each <span class="No-Break">executor implementation.</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>By completing this exercise, you will gain hands-on experience with different types of executors in Java and understand their behavior and use cases. This knowledge will help you make informed decisions when choosing an appropriate executor for your specific concurrency requirements in <span class="No-Break">Java applications.</span></p>
			<p>Remember to review the Java documentation, experiment with different executor implementations, and observe their behavior in action. <span class="No-Break">Happy exploring!</span></p>
