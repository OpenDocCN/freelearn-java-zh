- en: Advances in image processing are vital for the science and technology communities.
    However, as images become larger and more complex, even more advanced processing
    techniques are required. Automation becomes necessary too so that you can perform
    simple tasks easily and focus on more sophisticated issues. ImageJ is here to
    help—as one of the key powerful tools in the development of image processing,
    it lets you extract even more useful data from your images.

- en: '[Chapter 1](ch01.html "Chapter 1. Getting Started with ImageJ"), *Getting Started
    with ImageJ*, takes a look at the origin and use of ImageJ and discusses how to
    download and install it on different platforms. We will also take a look at the
    basic folder structure of ImageJ installation and configure it to be used.'

- en: '[Chapter 2](ch02.html "Chapter 2. Basic Image Processing with ImageJ"), *Basic
    Image Processing with ImageJ*, discusses the different image types that are supported
    by ImageJ. You will also learn how to load images from a disk or URL. We will
    take a look at the anatomy of an image window in ImageJ and the information that
    can be viewed. It will also deal with image scaling, calibration, lookup tables,
    adjusting image size, and adjusting channels.'

- en: '[Chapter 3](ch03.html "Chapter 3. Advanced Image Processing with ImageJ"),
    *Advanced Image Processing with ImageJ*, investigates the processing of different
    types of images. We will take a look at different sources of noise that can corrupt
    images and degrade their quality. You will also learn how to apply different corrections
    to images to fix these problems.'

- en: '[Chapter 4](ch04.html "Chapter 4. Image Segmentation and Feature Extraction
    with ImageJ"), *Image Segmentation and Feature Extraction with ImageJ*, looks
    at the ways to separate an image into a foreground and background. We will consider
    different methods to set the threshold in grayscale and color images.'

- en: '[Chapter 5](ch05.html "Chapter 5. Basic Measurements with ImageJ"), *Basic
    Measurements with ImageJ*, considers some methods to measure the parameters within
    images and time series. We will apply some of the techniques discussed in previous
    chapters to extract data from our images. You will also learn how to visualize
    dynamic data in a single image (kymographs).'

- en: '[Chapter 6](ch06.html "Chapter 6. Developing Macros in ImageJ"), *Developing
    Macros in ImageJ*, discusses how to create a macro using a recorder to discover
    the commands and functions that we can apply. Next, we will take a look at processing
    a folder full of images and saving the resulting images to the hard disk. Finally,
    we will look at the Batch Process mode, which allows ImageJ to process a folder
    in a similar way.'

- en: '[Chapter 7](ch07.html "Chapter 7. Explanation of ImageJ Constructs"), *Explanation
    of ImageJ Constructs*, looks at the framework of macros and plugins that are available
    in ImageJ. We will discuss some of the constructs that the ImageJ API exposes
    for use in scripting and plugins. Finally, we will describe how to set up an IDE
    to develop ImageJ and plugins using it as a standalone or Maven-based project.'

- en: '[Chapter 8](ch08.html "Chapter 8. Anatomy of ImageJ Plugins"), *Anatomy of
    ImageJ Plugins*, takes a look at the anatomy of plugins for ImageJ1.x and ImageJ2\.
    We will also take a look at some of the specific constructs that are used in plugins
    for both frameworks. This chapter examines how to compile, run, and debug plugins
    using the IDE or tools provided by ImageJ.'

- en: '[Chapter 9](ch09.html "Chapter 9. Creating ImageJ Plugins for Analysis"), *Creating
    ImageJ Plugins for Analysis*, develops a plugin from scratch using the Maven system
    and NetBeans IDE. We will discuss how to add a basic user interface to our plugin,
    allowing the user to change some of the parameters that influence the way the
    plugin functions. We will also add an external library to provide additional functionality
    that was not present in ImageJ.'

    from Here*, sums up the topics that are discussed in previous chapters and provides
    further resources that are available for you to continue developing your own plugins.
    The chapter also looks at some of the more advanced techniques that are available
    for developers.'
