WildFly is still the most popular Java Enterprise server out there. It is easy to use, has a clean management interface, a powerful command-line tool, a modular architecture, is light, and is lightning quick. If you need product support, it is very easy to move from WildFly to JBoss EAP Server and, importantly, the license and support costs won't break the bank.</p><p>This book gently introduces you to WildFly by looking at how to download and install the server. We then move on to look at configuring enterprise services and the various subsystems, and securing your server and applications. The topics become more advanced as the book progresses, so in the later part of the book, we look at high availability, which is achieved through clustering and load balancing.</p><p>Whether you are a Java developer who wishes to improve their knowledge of WildFly, or you are a server administrator who wants to gain a better understanding of the inner workings of WildFly, there is something in this book for everyone.</p><div class="section" title="What this book covers"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl1sec02"/>What this book covers</h1></div></div></div><p>
