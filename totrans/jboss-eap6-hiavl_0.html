In this book, I'd like to explore the topics on clustering, load balancing, failover, and session replication.</p><p>High availability is also a very interesting topic, and the technologies provided by open source communities are especially fun. In this book we'll learn how to use JBoss EAP6 together with other JBoss and Apache community tools to build a high-availability system.</p><p>Here is a brief list of the projects we'll use in this book: JBoss EAP 6, Apache httpd, mod_jk, and mod_cluster. When I'm writing this book, JBoss EAP 6.1.0.Final is the newest product version based on JBoss AS 7.2.x and can be downloaded freely from the JBoss community. This version is very stable with its clustering features, so we'll use it in our book.</p><p>Since AS 8.x, the project name of JBoss AS has been renamed to WildFly. Though the project name changed, its design hasn't changed much, and you can reuse most of the knowledge in this book for future versions of WildFly.</p><p>JBoss EAP6 has provided a domain management feature that can help us to centralize the management of many servers. This feature is very helpful in a clustering environment, because we don't have to manage each server separately. We'll check this feature in the book.</p><p>Transportation security is usually considered critical in business applications. In this book, I'll introduce the methods of applying SSL into a clustering environment.</p><div class="section" title="What this book covers"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl1sec02"/>What this book covers</h1></div></div></div><p>

<div class="section" title="What you need for this book"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl1sec03"/>What you need for this book</h1></div></div></div><p>Some basic knowledge on Linux/Unix is required to read this book. You may need to follow the shell commands shown in the book to configure the servers properly.</p><p>Some basic understanding of IP multicasting is strongly recommended. Because many clustering features rely on IP multicasting, you can better understand the design of EAP6 clustering with this knowledge.</p><p>If you want to follow the instructions in <a class="link" href="ch08.html" title="Chapter 8. Developing Distributed Applications">Chapter 8</a>,<span class="emphasis"><em> Developing Distributed Applications</em></span>, you may need some basic knowledge of EJB and Servlet development. In addition, some knowledge on Maven usage is preferred.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch06.html" title="Chapter 6. Clustering with SSL">Chapter 6</a>,<span class="emphasis"><em> Clustering with SSL</em></span>, and <a class="link" href="ch07.html" title="Chapter 7. Configuring mod_cluster with SSL">Chapter 7</a>,<span class="emphasis"><em> Configuring mod_cluster with SSL</em></span>, mainly focus on applying SSL in clustering. Some basic understanding of SSL/TLS technologies is needed if you want to follow the instructions in these two chapters.</p><p>When you are following the instructions in this book, please turn off the network firewall of your machine in case it blocks important ports needed by the cluster. If you are using Linux as your working environment, please disable SELinux because it will affect a lot on the clustering features. When you have fully understood the EAP6 clustering features, you can turn these protections back online and configure them properly to work with the EAP6 cluster.</p></div>
<div class="section" title="Who this book is for"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl1sec04"/>Who this book is for</h1></div></div></div><p>JBoss EAP6 administrators and JavaEE developers are the main audience of this book. Anyone who wants to know the coolest technologies provided by the JBoss community is recommended to read this book. I hope this book is not merely a step-by-step tutorial, so I've included some discussions on the design of JBoss EAP6 and relative projects.</p></div>
