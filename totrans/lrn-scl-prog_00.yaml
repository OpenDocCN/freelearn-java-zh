- en: Today's Scala is quite different from its earlier versions.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The second version of the language is more than twelve years old, and underwent
    multiple changes related to supported features and library implementation. Many
    features then considered crucial, such as support for XML literals, Swing, and
    Actors, were moved from the language core to the external libraries or replaced
    by open source alternatives. Another functionality that makes Scala the programming
    language as we know it today were added directly, or by including yet another
    open source library in the distribution. The most notable example is adopting
    Akka in version 2.10.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Scala 2.13, with its focus on modularizing standard libraries and simplifying
    collections, entails a further change. The changes, however, do not only affect
    the technical side of Scala. Years of using it to solve real problems have helped
    us to collect more knowledge about structuring functional programs and using object-oriented
    features in new ways to our advantage. The same way as it was customary to use
    earlier versions of Scala as "Java without semicolons," it is now routine to build
    programs using monad transformers and type-level programming techniques.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This book addresses both technical and architectural changes by providing a
    comprehensive guide to the redesigned standard library and collections, as well
    as covering type systems and first-level support for functions in depth. It discusses
    implicits as a primary mechanism for building type classes and looks at different
    ways of testing Scala code. It covers in detail abstract building blocks used
    in functional programming, affording sufficient knowledge to pick up and use any
    existing functional programming library out there. It explores reactive programming
    by covering the Akka framework and reactive streams. Finally, it talks about microservices
    and how to implement them with Scala and the Lagom framework.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As a software developer, you have a working knowledge of some imperative programming
    language, presumably Java.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You've got some basic Scala knowledge and a bit of experience of using it in
    actual projects. As a Scala beginner, you are surprised by the richness of its
    ecosystem, and the multiplicity of ways in which it allows you to solve problems,
    as well as the number of libraries available. You want to improve your Scala skills
    to be able to fully utilize the potential of the language and its reworked standard
    library, optimally use its rich type system to formulate your programs as closely
    as possible to the problem domain, and profit from its functional capabilities
    by understanding underlying paradigms, using relevant language features and open
    source libraries.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We expect the reader to be comfortable with structuring and implementing simple
    programs in Scala and familiar with SBT and REPL. No previous knowledge of reactive
    programming, Akka, or microservices is required, but familiarity with the underlying
    concepts would be beneficial.

- en: To work with the code examples in this book, Java 1.8+ and SBT 1.2+ need to
    be installed. The installation of Git is recommended to simplify checking out
    the source code from GitHub. For those readers who don't have the prerequisite
    software ready, we provide installation instructions for Java and SBT in Appendix
    A.
