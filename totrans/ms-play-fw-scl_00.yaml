- en: The Play Framework is an open source web application framework that is written
    in Java and Scala. It follows the Model-View-Controller architectural pattern.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It enables the user to use Scala for application development, keeping key properties
    and features of the Play Framework intact. This results in faster and scalable
    web apps. Also, it uses a more functional and "Scala idiomatic" style of programming,
    without sacrificing simplicity and developer friendliness.

- en: This book will provide advanced information on developing Scala web applications
    using the Play Framework. This will help Scala web developers master Play 2.0
    and use it for pro-Scala web app development.

- en: '[Chapter 1](ch01.html "Chapter 1. Getting Started with Play"), *Getting Started
    with Play*, explains how to build simple applications using the Play Framework.
    We also explore the project structure so that you can understand how the framework
    plugs in the required settings through a build file.'

- en: '[Chapter 2](ch02.html "Chapter 2. Defining Actions"), *Defining Actions*, explains
    how we can define an application-specific action with default parsers and results,
    and also with custom parsers and results.'

- en: '[Chapter 3](ch03.html "Chapter 3. Building Routes"), *Building Routes*, is
    where we see how essential routing is in a Play application. Apart from this,
    we also check out various default methods that Play provides for simplifying the
    process of routing.'

- en: '[Chapter 4](ch04.html "Chapter 4. Exploring Views"), *Exploring Views*, explains
    how to create views using Twirl and the various other helper methods provided
    by Play. In this chapter, you also learn how you can support multiple languages
    in your Play application using the built-in i18n API.'

- en: '[Chapter 5](ch05.html "Chapter 5. Working with Data"), *Working with Data*,
    demonstrates different ways of causing application data to persist in an application
    that we build using the Play Framework. In addition to this, you also get to understand
    how the Play Cache API can be used and how it works.'

- en: '[Chapter 6](ch06.html "Chapter 6. Reactive Data Streams"), *Reactive Data Streams*,
    discusses the concepts of Iteratee, Enumerator, and Enumeratee and how they can

- en: '[Chapter 8](ch08.html "Chapter 8. WebSockets and Actors"), *WebSockets and
    Actors*, briefly covers the Actor Model and the usage of Akka Actors in an application.
    We also define a WebSocket connection in a Play application with various constraints
    and requirements, using different approaches.'

- en: '[Chapter 9](ch09.html "Chapter 9. Testing"), *Testing*, shows you how a Play
    application can be tested using Specs2 and ScalaTest. We go through the different
    helper methods available for simplifying testing of a Play application.'

- en: '[Chapter 10](ch10.html "Chapter 10. Debugging and Logging"), *Debugging and
    Logging*, is where we configure the debugging of a Play application in the IDE.
    In this chapter, you get to learn how to start a Play application in the Scala
    console. This chapter also places emphasis on the logging API provided by the
    Play Framework and the methods of customizing the log format.'
