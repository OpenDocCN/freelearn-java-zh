- en: The initial and postback requests in JSF go through a JSF life cycle. When an
    initial request is processed, it only executes the *Restore View* and *Render
    Response* phases, because there is no user input or actions to process. On the
    other hand, when the life cycle handles a postback request, it executes all of
    the phases.

    partial processing (the `execute` attribute) and partial rendering (the `render`
    attribute).'
