- en: Modern software is driven by users wanting new features, with no defects, released
    rapidly – a very challenging task. Solo developers have given way to development
    teams working together on a single software product. Features are added in short
    iterative cycles, then released to production frequently – sometimes daily.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Achieving this requires excellence in development. We must ensure that our software
    is always ready to be deployed and free of defects when it is released into production.
    It must be easy for our developer colleagues to work with. Code must be easy for
    anyone to understand and change. When the team makes those changes, we must have
    confidence that our new features work properly and that we have not broken any
    existing features.

    These practices are the technical foundation behind a code base that is easy and
    safe to change and always ready to be deployed.'

    have confidence that your code works as you think it should. You will have the
    safety of an ever-growing suite of fast-running tests, keeping a watchful eye
    over the whole code base as the team makes changes. You will learn how to organize
    your code to avoid difficulties caused by external systems such as payment services
    or database engines. You will reduce your dependence on slower forms of testing.

    basics, and who want to be effective in a high-performance Agile development team.
    The techniques described in this book enable your code to be delivered to production
    with few defects, and a structure that can be easily and safely changed. This
    is the technical basis of agility.

    promotes a design step before we write code. We will consider various options

    a useful set of guidelines to help design object-oriented code. This chapter is
    a review of those principles so that they are ready for us to apply in the rest

    bring more of our code under a TDD unit test, reducing our need for slower integration
    testing.'
