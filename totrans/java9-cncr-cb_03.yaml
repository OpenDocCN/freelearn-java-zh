    Thread Synchronization*, you learned the concepts of synchronization and critical
    sections. Basically, we talk about synchronization when more than one concurrent
    task shares a resource, for example, an object or an attribute of an object. The
    blocks of code that access this shared resource are called critical sections.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In this recipe, you will learn how to use the semaphore mechanism provided by
    the Java language. A semaphore is a counter that protects access to one or more
    shared resources.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The concept of a semaphore was introduced by Edsger Dijkstra in 1965 and was
    used for the first time in the THEOS operating system.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When a thread wants to access one of the shared resources, it must first acquire
    the semaphore. If the internal counter of the semaphore is greater than 0, the
    semaphore decrements the counter and allows access to the shared resource. A counter
    bigger than 0 implies that there are free resources that can be used, so the thread
    can access and use one of them.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Otherwise, if the counter is 0, the semaphore puts the thread to sleep until
    the counter is greater than 0\. A value of 0 in the counter means all the shared
    resources are used by other threads, so the thread that wants to use one of them
    must wait until one is free.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When the thread has finished using the shared resource, it must release the
    semaphore so that another thread can access the resource. This operation increases
    the internal counter of the semaphore.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In this recipe, you will learn how to use the `Semaphore` class to protect more
    than one copy of a resource. You are going to implement an example, which has
    a print queue that could print documents in three different printers.

    the interruption of the thread and doesn''t throw any exceptions.'

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The concept of fairness is used by the Java language in all classes that can
    have various threads blocked and are waiting for the release of a synchronization
    resource (for example, a semaphore). The default mode is called **non-fair mode**.
    In this mode, when the synchronization resource is released, one of the waiting
    threads is selected and is given this resource; however, it's selected without
    any criteria. Fair mode, on the other hand, changes this behavior and selects
    the thread that has been waiting for the longest period of time.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As it occurs with other classes, the `Semaphore` class admits a second parameter
    in its constructor. This parameter must take a Boolean value. If you give it a
    false value, you are creating a semaphore that will work in non-fair mode. You
    will get the same behavior if you don't use this parameter. If you give it a true
    value, you are creating a semaphore that will work in fair mode.

    wait until a set of operations are made. It's called the `CountDownLatch` class.
    This class is initialized with an integer number, which is the number of operations
    the threads are going to wait for. When a thread wants to wait for the execution
    of these operations, it uses the `await()` method. This method puts the thread
    to sleep until the operations are completed. When one of these operations finishes,
    it uses the `countDown()` method to decrement the internal counter of the `CountDownLatch`
    class. When the counter arrives at `0`, the class wakes up all the threads that
    were sleeping in the `await()` method.

- en: The Java concurrency API provides a synchronizing utility that allows the synchronization
    of two or more threads at a determined point. It's the `CyclicBarrier` class.
    This class is similar to the `CountDownLatch` class explained in the *Waiting
    for multiple concurrent events* recipe in this chapter, but it presents some differences
    that make it a more powerful class.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The `CyclicBarrier` class is initialized with an integer number, which is the
    number of threads that will be synchronized at a determined point. When one of
    these threads arrives at the determined point, it calls the `await()` method to
    wait for the other threads. When the thread calls this method, the `CyclicBarrier`
    class blocks the thread that is sleeping until the other threads arrive. When
    the last thread calls the `await()` method of the `CyclicBarrier` object, it wakes
    up all the threads that were waiting and continues with its job.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One interesting advantage of the `CyclicBarrier` class is that you can pass
    an additional `Runnable` object as an initialization parameter, and the `CyclicBarrier`
    class executes this object as a thread when all the threads arrive at the common
    point. This characteristic makes this class adequate for parallelization of tasks
    using the divide and conquer programming technique.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In this recipe, you will learn how to use the `CyclicBarrier` class to synchronize
    a set of threads at a determined point. You will also use a `Runnable` object
    that will be executed after all the threads arrive at this point. In the example,
    you will look for a number in a matrix of numbers. The matrix will be divided
    into subsets (using the divide and conquer technique), so each thread will look
    for the number in one subset. Once all the threads have finished their respective
    jobs, a final task will unify their results.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The program starts creating a `Phaser` object that will control the synchronization
    of the threads at the end of each phase. The constructor of `Phaser` receives
    the number of participants as a parameter. In our case, `Phaser` has three participants.
    This number indicates `Phaser` the number of threads that need to execute the
    `arriveAndAwaitAdvance()` method before `Phaser` could change the phase and wake
    up the threads that have been sleeping.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Once `Phaser` has been created, we launch three threads that are executed using
    three different `FileSearch` objects.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In this example, we use paths of the Windows operating system. If you work with
    another operating system, modify the paths to adapt them to existing paths in
    your environment, such as `/var/log`, or similar.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The first instruction in the `run()` method of this `FileSearch` object is a
    call to the `arriveAndAwaitAdvance()` method of the `Phaser` object. As mentioned
    earlier, `Phaser` knows the number of threads that we want to synchronize. When
    a thread calls this method, `Phaser` decreases the number of threads that have
    to finalize the actual phase and puts this thread to sleep until all the remaining
    threads finish this phase. Calling this method at the beginning of the `run()`
    method ensures that none of the `FileSearch` threads begin their job until all
    the threads are created.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: At the end of phase one and phase two, we check whether the phase has generated
    results and the list with the results has elements or the phase hasn't generated
    results and the list is empty. In the first case, the `checkResults()` method
    calls `arriveAndAwaitAdvance()` as explained earlier. In the second case, if the
    list is empty, there's no point in the thread continuing with its execution, so
    it ends its execution. But you have to notify the `Phaser` object that there will
    be one less participant. For this, we used `arriveAndDeregister()`. This notifies
    `phaser` that the thread has finished the actual phase, but it won't participate
    in future phases, therefore, `phaser` won't have to wait for it to continue.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: At the end of the phase three implemented in the `showInfo()` method, there
    is a call to the `arriveAndAwaitAdvance()` method of `phaser`. With this call,
    we guarantee that all the threads finish at the same time. When this method ends
    its execution, there is a call to the `arriveAndDeregister()` method of `phaser`.
    With this call, we deregister the threads of `phaser`, as explained before, so
    when all the threads finish, `phaser` will have zero participants.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Finally, the `main()` method waits for the completion of the three threads and
    calls the `isTerminated()` method of `phaser`. When `phaser` has zero participants,
    it enters the so-called termination state, and this method returns `true`. As
    we deregister all the threads of `phaser`, it will be in the termination state,
    and this call will print `true` to the console.

    actual phase as parameters, where 0 is the number of the first phase and the number
    of registered participants. The most useful parameter is the actual phase. If
    you execute a different operation depending on the actual phase, you have to use
    an alternative structure (`if...else` or `switch`) to select the operation you
    want to execute. In the example, we used a `switch` structure to select a different

    phases. If `phaser` returns `true`, then `phaser` still wakes up the pending threads
    but moves `phaser` to the terminated state. With this, all future calls to any
    method of `phaser` will return immediately, and the `isTerminated()` method will
    return `true`.

    This calling doesn't establish a relation between the `Student` object or the

    phaser is only a number. There is no relationship between `phaser` and the participants.

- en: The consumer begins with an empty buffer and calls `Exchanger` to synchronize
    with the producer. It needs data to consume. The producer begins its execution
    with an empty buffer. It creates 10 strings, stores them in the buffer, and uses
    the `Exchanger` to synchronize with the consumer.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: At this point, both the threads (producer and consumer) are in `Exchanger`,
    which changes the data structures. So when the consumer returns from the `exchange()`
    method, it will have a buffer with 10 strings. When the producer returns from
    the `exchange()` method, it will have an empty buffer to fill again. This operation
    will be repeated 10 times.

    we created an instance of this class and sent it as a parameter to a `SeedGenerator`
    task. This task uses the `complete()` method to send the calculated value, and
    the `main()` method uses the `get()` method to obtain the value. The `get()` method
    sleeps the current thread until `CompletableFuture` has been completed.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Then, we used the `supplyAsync()` method to generate a `CompletableFuture` object.
    This method receives an implementation of the `Supplier` interface as a parameter.
    This interface provides the `get()` method that must return a value. The `supplyAsync()`
    method returns `CompletableFuture`, which will be completed when the `get()` method
    finishes its execution; the value of completion is the value returned by that
    method. The `CompletableFuture` object returned will be executed by a task in
    the `ForkJoinPool` returns the static method `commonPool()`.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    method in a `CompletableFuture` object, and you must pass an implementation of
    the `Function` interface as a parameter that can be expressed directly in the
    code using a functional style or an independent object. One powerful characteristic
    is that the value generated by `CompletableFuture` will be passed as a parameter
    to the `Function`. That is to say, in our case, all the three steps will receive
    a random list of numbers as parameters. The `CompletableFuture` class returned
    will be executed by a task in the `ForkJoinPool` returns the static method `commonPool()`.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Finally, we used the `allOf()` static method of the `CompletableFuture` class
    to wait for the finalization of various tasks. This method receives a variable
    list of `CompletableFuture` objects and returns a `CompletableFuture` class that
    will be completed when all the `CompletableFuture` class passed as parameters
    are completed. We also used the `thenAcceptAsync()` method as another way to synchronize
    tasks because this method receives `Consumer` as a parameter that is executed
    by the default executor when the `CompletableFuture` object used to call the method
    is completed. Finally, we used the `join()` method to wait for the finalization
    of the last `CompletableFuture` object.
