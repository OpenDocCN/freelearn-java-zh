- en: In the previous chapter, we learned the importance of software testing, types
    of software testing to perform on a Spring Batch application with the help of
    frameworks such as JUnit, Mockito on Spring Batch components and Spring support,
    APIs to perform unit testing, integration testing, and functional testing on Spring
    Batch applications. The Spring Batch project development setup needs a system
    to contain Java and IDE (Eclipse), and a project needs to be set up with the dependencies
    configuration. Also, Spring Batch administration is another important aspect to
    understand.

    released by Oracle and aimed at Java developers using Solaris, Linux, Mac OS X,
    or Windows. The JDK can be downloaded from the Oracle web downloads ([http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html)).

    (**IDEs**) with base workspace to work on projects, along with extensible plugins
    for customizing it. Intelij IDEA and NetBeans are some of the other prominent
    IDEs. We pick the Eclipse IDE for Java EE developers through [https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/eclipse-ide-java-ee-developers/keplersr2](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/eclipse-ide-java-ee-developers/keplersr2).

    to get the `eclipse` folder. Under the `eclipse` directory, we can observe the
    executable eclipse program (`eclipse.exe`), which opens the Eclipse IDE as shown
    in the following screenshot, making sure the Java Development Kit is installed
    on the machine and is available on system path.

    in the instructions at [https://www.eclipse.org/m2e/](https://www.eclipse.org/m2e/),
    and a Java project with Maven dependencies can be managed with the required dependencies
    for the Spring Batch job, as mentioned in the *Job design and executions* section
    of the [Chapter 1](ch01.xhtml "Chapter 1. Spring Batch Fundamentals"), *Spring
    Batch Fundamentals*.

    monitoring the job performance statistics of job executions. Spring Batch is available
    with an administration project from Spring to have a web-based control tool, namely,
    Spring Batch Admin project. Spring Batch Admin is an easily deployable project
    with very good documentation. The documentation of the Spring Batch Admin project
    is available at [http://docs.spring.io/spring-batch-admin/getting-started.html](http://docs.spring.io/spring-batch-admin/getting-started.html).
