    it is crucial to understand the following technologies: Java 17, Maven, Git, and
    Docker. Familiarity with Java 17 is assumed, including knowledge of its syntax,
    object-oriented programming concepts, and familiarity with core libraries and
    frameworks. Understanding Maven will be beneficial, as it is a popular build automation
    tool for managing dependencies and building Java projects. Proficiency in Git,
    a version control system, is necessary to track and manage source code changes
    effectively. Lastly, knowledge of Docker, a containerization platform, will help
    understand how to package and deploy software applications in isolated environments.'
