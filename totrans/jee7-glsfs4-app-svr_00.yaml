- en: Java Enterprise Edition 7, the latest version of Java EE, adds several new features
    to the specification. Several existing Java EE APIs have gone through major improvements
    in this version of the specification; additionally, some brand new APIs have been
    added to Java EE. This book includes coverage of the latest versions of the most
    popular Java EE specifications, including JavaServer Faces (JSF), Java Persistence
    API (JPA), Enterprise JavaBeans (EJB), Contexts and Dependency Injection (CDI),
    the new Java API for JSON Processing (JSON-P), WebSocket, the completely revamped
    Java Messaging Service (JMS) API 2.0, the Java API for XML Web Services (JAX-WS)
    and the Java API for RESTful Web Services (JAX-RS), as well as securing Java EE
    applications.
