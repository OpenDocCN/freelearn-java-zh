<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.3.1">While trying to give you advice on keeping your code clean and your design clear, it’s also important to talk about some practices that will help you little by little, day by day. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.3.2">Apart from dedicating specific moments to refactoring, maintaining a consistent level of quality in your day-to-day work is essential for the overall health and efficiency of your software development process. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.3.3">Achieving this doesn’t always require extensive time or effort; small, targeted actions can make a significant difference. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.3.4">By incorporating the practices we’re about to describe into your daily routine, you can not only prevent the accumulation of technical debt but also improve the overall quality and maintainability of your code base. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.3.5">These efforts may seem small in isolation but, collectively, they can have a substantial impact on the long-term success of your </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.4.1">software projects.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.5.1">In this chapter, we’re going to cover the following </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.6.1">main topics:</span></span></p>

<h1 id="_idParaDest-175"><a id="_idTextAnchor185"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.17.1">Code versioning</span></h1>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.18.1">I have a soft spot for code versioning, and that’s weird, I get it. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.18.2">It was one of the first things I had to </span><a id="_idIndexMarker676"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.19.1">learn the hard way when I started working right after graduation. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.19.2">Incredibly, no one had ever mentioned code versioning throughout my entire computer science studies. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.19.3">This makes me think that maybe my degree program was lacking in this regard, and it shows how important code versioning is in the life of a developer from </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.20.1">day one.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.21.1">Anyway, let’s get to the point. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.21.2">To tell you what code versioning is, I could start by saying that it is something that can save your day when things go wrong; I’ll admit that it sounds a bit too generic as a description, so I’ll go </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.22.1">into detail.</span></span></p>
<p><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.23.1">Version control</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.24.1"> is like a time </span><a id="_idIndexMarker677"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.25.1">machine for your files. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.25.2">It keeps track of all the changes you make so you can easily jump back to any previous version when needed. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.25.3">This system is usually referred to as a </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.26.1">versioning control system</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.27.1"> (</span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.28.1">VCS</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.29.1">) and there </span><a id="_idIndexMarker678"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.30.1">are many implementations of them. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.30.2">With a VCS, you can turn back the clock on individual files or the entire project, check how things have changed over time, figure out who messed with something that’s causing trouble, identify when an issue was introduced, and much more. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.30.3">Plus, using a VCS means that if you </span><a id="_idIndexMarker679"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.31.1">mess things up or lose files, you’ve got a safety net for easy recovery, and it doesn’t add much complexity to your workflow. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.31.2">Changes are typically marked with a code, often called the “revision number,” “revision level,” or just “revision.” </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.31.3">For instance, the original set of files is labeled “revision 1.” </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.31.4">When the first change happens, it becomes “revision 2,” and this pattern continues. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.31.5">Every revision comes with a timestamp and the name of the person who made the change. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.31.6">Revisions can be compared, restored, and, in some cases, merged, making it a powerful way to manage the evolution of files. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.31.7">The advantages of a VCS increase as the complexity of the project increases and the number of team </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.32.1">members increases.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.33.1">As we already said, VCSs are useful for reverting errors; in case of trouble, you can restore your class, your package, and your module to a previous version that was still okay and start again. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.33.2">But this is not the only reason why everyone in this industry must use </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.34.1">a VCS.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.35.1">Developers can collaborate and team up on a project using VCSs. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.35.2">They can all access the database at the same time to check out past versions, making it simpler for them to collaborate effectively, regardless of their geographical locations. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.35.3">Version control also allows developers to maintain a historical record of changes, attributing them to specific contributors. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.35.4">This capability empowers them to roll back to earlier document versions and gain insights into how various team members’ contributions have shaped the project’s evolution. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.35.5">In the realm of collaborative development, it’s essential to have a clear understanding of the commits being added to the repository and the reasons behind these commits to prevent conflicts and ensure the stability of the source code. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.35.6">Collaborative platforms (for example, GitHub and GitLab) that are built around VCSs offer centralized repositories (we’ll jump into that later), tools for issue tracking and management, as well as threaded discussions and forums. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.35.7">These features streamline a team-oriented approach to the software development </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.36.1">life cycle.</span></span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-176"><a id="_idTextAnchor186"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.37.1">Graph structure</span></h2>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.38.1">In graph theory, think of revisions like a tree growing from a main line. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.38.2">Picture </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.39.1">branches</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.40.1"> coming out </span><a id="_idIndexMarker680"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.41.1">of this main line, forming a tree shape. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.41.2">Even though it’s more complex and looks like a graph, you can simplify it in your mind as a “tree with merges” for </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.42.1">practical use.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.43.1">Revisions happen </span><a id="_idIndexMarker681"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.44.1">one after another over time and can be put in a specific order, either by their revision number or the time they were made. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.44.2">Each revision is based on the ones before it, but sometimes, you can completely replace an earlier revision by getting rid of everything and putting in new stuff. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.44.3">In the simplest case, with no extra branches or undoing, each revision is only connected to the one just before it, making a straight line. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.44.4">The latest version is called the </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.45.1">HEAD</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.46.1"> revision. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.46.2">In graph theory terms, if you think of each revision as a point and each connection between revisions like an arrow (usually going from older to newer, following the timeline), this setup makes a </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.47.1">straight-line graph:</span></span></p>

<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.156.1">Branches are like separate workspaces for developers to build new features or fix issues in a software project. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.156.2">We saw that branches can be combined with the main code when the work is finished. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.156.3">This separation helps you avoid mixing up changes and makes it easier to fix mistakes. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.156.4">If everyone works on their branch, no one should mess up what others </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.157.1">are doing.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.158.1">A branching strategy is a plan that software teams use for writing, combining, and deploying code when they use VCSs. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.158.2">It’s like a set of rules that tells developers how to work with the </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.159.1">shared code.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.160.1">This strategy is crucial because it keeps things organized and prevents problems when many developers are working at the same time. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.160.2">Without it, there could be conflicts when everyone tries to add their changes simultaneously. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.160.3">This would slow down the process of getting code ready to use – and cause a certain amount </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.161.1">of frustration!</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.162.1">By following a branching strategy, developers can work together without causing issues. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.162.2">It lets teams </span><a id="_idIndexMarker703"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.163.1">work on different things at the same time </span><a id="_idIndexMarker704"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.164.1">and release code faster with fewer conflicts. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.164.2">It’s all about having a clear process for making changes to the code; you can set up your own branching models, of course, but there are a bunch of them that have become quite successful over the years. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.164.3">The one we’re about to show will use only Distributed VCSs since are the only ones that are still </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.165.1">in use.</span></span></p>

<p><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.167.1">Trunk-based development</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.168.1"> is a way of working where all developers make their changes directly </span><a id="_idIndexMarker705"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.169.1">in the main part of the code, which we call the </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.170.1">trunk</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.171.1">. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.171.2">This is the part of the code that’s ready to be used in the project. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.171.3">Developers are encouraged to save their work often and use special techniques to manage changes that aren’t </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.172.1">ready yet.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.173.1">We also focus </span><a id="_idIndexMarker706"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.174.1">on automated testing, meaning the computer checks if the code is working well all the time. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.174.2">We do this to make sure any changes we make are tested thoroughly before they are used in </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.175.1">the project.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.176.1">Sometimes, if a task takes a long time, a developer might create a separate branch from the main code, make changes there, and then bring those changes back to the main part when they’re done. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.176.2">But the main idea in trunk-based development is to use separate branches as little as possible and have everyone work together on the main part of the code most of the time. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.176.3">The following diagram represents a very simple sequence of commits (a graph made by only one, linear path) that have been done on a </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.177.1">single branch:</span></span></p>

<h2 id="_idParaDest-181"><a id="_idTextAnchor191"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.383.1">Best practices</span></h2>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.384.1">Although it might sound like a simple task, almost like saving a file in the cloud so that you don’t lose it if your computer gets stolen, managing files and project versions is another crucial </span><a id="_idIndexMarker722"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.385.1">aspect of improving your project management. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.385.2">Speaking from experience, it’s good not to underestimate this matter; it’s one of the things that sets someone who cares apart. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.385.3">Here are some tips we feel like sharing; as usual, it’s all quite flexible and based on </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.386.1">our experience.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.387.1">Make it a habit to commit to your work frequently and at the earliest opportunity. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.387.2">By doing this, you ensure that each commit captures a specific set of related changes. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.387.3">Keep your commits small and focused on a single task or feature. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.387.4">However, remember not to commit unfinished work as this can potentially disrupt the stability of the code base and create issues (golden rule: do not break the build on the main branch!). </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.387.5">Instead, break your work into smaller, logical chunks, and commit them as you complete each part (or use a feature flag if you feel like that’s the case). </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.387.6">This practice helps maintain a clean and reliable version history, making it easier to track the evolution of your project and collaborate effectively with </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.388.1">your team.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.389.1">Always run tests on your code before you commit changes. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.389.2">Testing helps ensure that a commit is not just functioning as expected but also that it doesn’t introduce any unintended problems or errors into the code base (golden rule: do not break the build on the main branch! </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.389.3">Yes, I know I already said that). </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.389.4">This step is crucial because sharing untested commits with your fellow developers can lead to confusion, disruptions in the project, and a lot of extra work down the line. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.389.5">By rigorously testing your changes before committing, you not only safeguard the stability of the project but also demonstrate your commitment to quality and collaboration within the development team. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.389.6">It’s a smart practice to help maintain a smooth and efficient workflow, building trust among your colleagues, and reducing the need for extensive debugging or troubleshooting later on. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.389.7">Remember, a well-tested commit is a valuable contribution to </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.390.1">the project.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.391.1">When writing a commit message, aim for clarity and conciseness. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.391.2">The summary should be a brief yet informative glimpse into the nature of your changes, emphasizing their intent and how they distinguish themselves from the previous state of the code. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.391.3">In addition to a well-written summary, consider providing a more detailed description of your changes in the body of the commit message. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.391.4">This helps fellow developers, and even your future self, understand the context and significance of your modifications. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.391.5">Another valuable </span><a id="_idIndexMarker723"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.392.1">practice is linking your code changes to relevant work items or issues, enhancing traceability and project management. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.392.2">By associating your commits with specific tasks or tickets, you create a more organized and transparent system for tracking the progress of your work. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.392.3">For example, a common practice for Jira users (Jira is a very popular issue tracker) is to include the issue ID in the commit message. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.392.4">At the end of the day, your commit message serves as a crucial communication tool within your development team. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.392.5">A well-structured message ensures that your contributions are easily understood and integrated into the project’s development history, facilitating collaboration and maintaining a clear record of </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.393.1">your work.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.394.1">One last piece of advice: when managing sensitive information such as passwords, it is crucial to exercise vigilant caution. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.394.2">Avoid the inadvertent exposure of production passwords and adopt alternative methods for secure storage. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.394.3">One recommended approach is to leverage a specialized system such as Vault, which provides a secure and centralized repository for managing sensitive credentials. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.394.4">By steering clear of committing production passwords directly and opting for such dedicated systems, you enhance the overall security posture of your data handling practices. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.394.5">This proactive approach not only mitigates the risk of inadvertent leaks but also ensures a more robust and scalable solution for safeguarding critical </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.395.1">authentication information.</span></span></p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-182"><a id="_idTextAnchor192"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.396.1">Code formatting and style</span></h1>

<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.400.1">Code formatting </span><a id="_idIndexMarker725"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.401.1">means arranging your computer program in a neat and organized way. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.401.2">It’s like making sure your writing follows specific rules so that it’s easy to read and understand. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.401.3">When you format your code, you decide on things such as how much space to leave between lines, where to put curly braces, and how to name things. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.401.4">This makes your code more readable, consistent, and easier to </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.402.1">work with.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.403.1">There are various </span><a id="_idIndexMarker726"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.404.1">rules and habits to follow when arranging code in Java, but, in our opinion, it’s also something very intuitive, almost like a natural skill for us software engineers. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.404.2">We’d bet that even without discussing it, we all know which one we prefer between the following two code snippets. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.404.3">Here’s the </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.405.1">first one:</span></span></p>

public class Main {
public static void main(String[] args) {
System.out.println("Hello there!");
}
}</span></pre> <p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.410.1">We think we all prefer the first snippet, and that’s because the second one lacks proper indentation, which is the first and crucial aspect of how we format our code. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.410.2">However, no matter the style, the entire team needs to stick to the same standard, which means a set of internal rules that we all expect everyone to follow. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.410.3">Rules need to be established for each of the aspects that govern code formatting; let’s take a look at the </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.411.1">main ones.</span></span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-183"><a id="_idTextAnchor193"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.412.1">Indentation</span></h2>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.413.1">We use indentation </span><a id="_idIndexMarker727"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.414.1">to help us move through a file’s structure. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.414.2">If you think about it, a Java source file is a hierarchy of elements: we have the entire file, and then we have the classes inside it. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.414.3">Within classes, there are methods, and within methods, we have blocks, and so on, in a repeating pattern, including </span><strong class="source-inline"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.415.1">if</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.416.1"> statements, loops, and more. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.416.2">To help us navigate through all of this, we use indentation. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.416.3">Without indentation, even the simplest methods would be hard to understand. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.416.4">As we’ve mentioned before, code is designed to be run by machines but also to be understood </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.417.1">by humans:</span></span></p>
<pre class="source-code"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.418.1">

        .println("Even number");
    } else {System.out.println("Odd number");}}</span></pre> <p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.419.1">Understanding this very simple code takes much longer if the method is not properly indented. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.419.2">This code prints one string if the given number is even and another if it’s odd. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.419.3">Understanding this method would have been much quicker if it had been </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.420.1">indented correctly:</span></span></p>

    } else {
        System.out.println("Odd number");
    }
}</span></pre> <p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.422.1">There are mainly two aspects related to indentation: when to break to a new line and how much to move the indented code to the right. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.422.2">For example, you can choose to indent the code </span><a id="_idIndexMarker728"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.423.1">with a tab or four spaces, or whatever you prefer, so long as everyone follows the </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.424.1">same style.</span></span></p>

<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.522.1">Other types of comments that I don’t find particularly useful, except for rare exceptions, are the infamous </span><strong class="source-inline"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.523.1">TODO</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.524.1"> and </span><strong class="source-inline"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.525.1">FIXME</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.526.1">. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.526.2">If you know you need to fix something, just fix it. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.526.3">If you can’t do it right away, record the task in your task management system (for example, Jira) and move on. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.526.4">Putting </span><strong class="source-inline"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.527.1">FIXME</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.528.1"> in the code only adds confusion. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.528.2">When someone sees that </span><strong class="source-inline"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.529.1">FIXME</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.530.1"> in 2 years, they’ll wonder, “Why hasn’t it been fixed yet? </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.530.2">Maybe it’s not important.” </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.530.3">The same goes </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.531.1">for </span></span><span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.532.1">TODO</span></strong></span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.533.1">.</span></span></p>

<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.628.1">For example, </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.629.1">integrated development environments</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.630.1"> (</span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.631.1">IDEs</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.632.1">) play a significant role in supporting </span><a id="_idIndexMarker752"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.633.1">code formatting by providing tools and features to help developers adhere to coding standards and automatically format their code. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.633.2">IDEs facilitate code formatting by performing auto-indentation – that is, automatically indenting code blocks – making it easier to read and understand the code’s structure. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.633.3">Indentation can be customized according to the coding standards of your project. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.633.4">Furthermore, most IDEs allow developers to define and customize code style preferences. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.633.5">These preferences include settings for indentation, brace placement, line wrapping, and naming conventions. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.633.6">Developers can tailor these settings to match the coding standards of their project or organization. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.633.7">IDEs come with built-in or customizable code formatters that automatically format your code based on the defined coding style preferences. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.633.8">These formatters ensure that your code follows the established </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.634.1">standards consistently.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.635.1">But don’t worry, you don’t have to set up all the nitty-gritty of your IDE’s formatting settings details; most of them – especially the most used ones – have the chance to export the </span><a id="_idIndexMarker753"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.636.1">so-called </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.637.1">code style formatter</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.638.1">. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.638.2">You just have to discover how your IDE does it (or just google it), export your file, and make sure everyone in the team is using that file, importing it in their IDE. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.638.3">When you format your code in your IDE – via the relative command or shortcut – the code style will be the same for everyone... </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.638.4">everyone who’s using the same IDE, of course. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.638.5">Yes, because these code styles are specific for each IDE; NetBeans’ one is different from </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.639.1">Eclipse’s one.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.640.1">There are many </span><a id="_idIndexMarker754"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.641.1">solutions to this problem. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.641.2">For example, you could </span><a id="_idIndexMarker755"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.642.1">try to manually edit your exported code style file (which is always a text file) so that it adapts to the destination IDE; however, I don’t feel like advising you to do that. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.642.2">A possible solution could be to use a cross-IDE tool, a tool that is </span><a id="_idIndexMarker756"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.643.1">essentially the same for everyone. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.643.2">For example, there is a tool called </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.644.1">CodeConfig</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.645.1"> (</span><a href="https://editorconfig.org"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.646.1">https://editorconfig.org</span></a><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.647.1">) that allows you to configure a code style and can be installed on numerous different IDEs (many, such as IntelliJ, support it natively). </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.647.2">Alternatively, you could move the problem </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.648.1">somewhere else.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.649.1">If you’re working on a Java project, you’re probably using a build automation tool such as Gradle or Maven. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.649.2">These tools allow you to compile code, among other things, and, in general, simplify the entire development life cycle. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.649.3">As you know, there are various plugins available for these tools. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.649.4">Some of them directly modify the code itself – in this book, we’ve seen examples such as Lombok </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.650.1">and MapStruct.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.651.1">Some plugins intend to check your code for any problems with code style. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.651.2">One of the most famous is Checkstyle. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.651.3">The Apache Maven Checkstyle Plugin (see the </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.652.1">Further reading</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.653.1"> section) integrates the Checkstyle tool into your Maven build process to enforce coding style and standards on your Java source code. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.653.2">Checkstyle is an open source static code analysis tool that checks your Java code against a set of predefined coding conventions and style rules. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.653.3">You define your coding style rules and preferences in a Checkstyle configuration file, typically named </span><strong class="source-inline"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.654.1">checkstyle.xml</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.655.1">. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.655.2">This file specifies which coding standards you want to enforce, such as naming conventions, indentation, and formatting rules. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.655.3">Then, the Apache Maven Checkstyle Plugin is configured in your project’s </span><strong class="source-inline"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.656.1">pom.xml</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.657.1"> file. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.657.2">You specify the Checkstyle rules file and other settings to be used during the build. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.657.3">When you run a Maven build (for example, via </span><strong class="source-inline"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.658.1">mvn clean install</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.659.1">), the Apache Maven Checkstyle Plugin is executed as part of the build process. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.659.2">It scans your Java source code files for violations of the defined coding standards. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.659.3">If Checkstyle detects any violations, it generates a report that lists the issues found in your code. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.659.4">This report can be viewed in various formats, such as HTML or XML. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.659.5">You can configure </span><a id="_idIndexMarker757"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.660.1">the plugin to either fail the build if violations are found or generate a warning report without failing the build. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.660.2">The choice depends </span><a id="_idIndexMarker758"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.661.1">on your project’s requirements. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.661.2">The Apache Maven Checkstyle Plugin is useful to get an overview of any problems you might have, but it does not fix them </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.662.1">for you.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.663.1">Some plugins handle code formatting. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.663.2">By integrating these plugins into your development process, you can ensure that your code is automatically formatted with every build, without </span><a id="_idIndexMarker759"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.664.1">the need for manual intervention. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.664.2">A Maven plugin that you could use is </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.665.1">maven-formatter-plugin</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.666.1"> (</span><a href="https://code.revelc.net/formatter-maven-plugin"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.667.1">https://code.revelc.net/formatter-maven-plugin</span></a><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.668.1">), which, by default, supports the “Eclipse style” but can be configured with any code style. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.668.2">We haven’t eliminated the complexity of the “file transfer” step, but we’ve integrated code formatting into our development cycle. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.668.3">But we can be even smarter </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.669.1">than that.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.670.1">In software companies, CI/CD tools such as GitLab or Jenkins are now widespread. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.670.2">If you’re new to the concept, a CI/CD pipeline is an automated workflow that streamlines the software development and delivery process. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.670.3">It starts with CI, where developers frequently merge their code changes into a shared repository. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.670.4">Automated builds, testing, and code </span><a id="_idIndexMarker760"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.671.1">analysis are performed to ensure code quality and identify issues early. </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.672.1">Continuous delivery</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.673.1"> (</span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.674.1">CD</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.675.1">) follows CI and involves deploying code changes to staging or pre-production environments. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.675.2">Additional testing and quality checks are conducted to simulate production conditions. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.675.3">After successful testing, the code can be automatically deployed to the </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.676.1">production environment.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.677.1">When it comes to formatting and styling code, you can set up an automatic system that checks how code is written. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.677.2">Every time new pieces of code are pushed into the repository, this automatic system checks if the code follows formatting rules. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.677.3">Depending on how we set up this system, it can be a simple check that tells us if the code isn’t written correctly, or it can be stricter and stop the process if there are serious issues (though this rarely happens). </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.677.4">Furthermore, this system can do something really helpful: it can fix poorly written code so that it follows the shared rules of our group or company. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.677.5">In practice, this system “re-commits” the same pieces of code, but this time, they are formatted correctly. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.677.6">This means we might not have to worry about fixing the code </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.678.1">manually anymore.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.679.1">One last side note: formatting code in the same way is also important to reduce merge conflicts and unintentional code commits. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.679.2">Let’s imagine that Developer A uses </span><strong class="source-inline"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.680.1">CodeStyleA</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.681.1">, while Developer B uses </span><strong class="source-inline"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.682.1">CodeStyleB</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.683.1"> (as expected). </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.683.2">Developer A makes a small change, let’s say a five-line method, inside a class. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.683.3">Being diligent, they initiate code formatting </span><a id="_idIndexMarker761"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.684.1">for the entire class using their IDE. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.684.2">Since Developer A is using their personalized </span><strong class="source-inline"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.685.1">CodeStyleA</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.686.1">, they will likely unintentionally commit other parts of the class that weren’t the intended focus of the change. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.686.2">This results in lines that were altered by Developer A but, in a way, weren’t supposed to be. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.686.3">On the other hand, Developer B is making changes to the same class but in a different place. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.686.4">When they need to push their code, they find the same lines changed by Developer A, but only because Developer A </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.687.1">incorrectly formatted</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.688.1"> the code. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.688.2">This may seem like an edge case, but it’s not uncommon – I’ve seen it happen many times. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.688.3">It’s not a disaster by any means, but it’s time wasted that can be saved with a bit </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.689.1">of care.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.690.1">Now that we’ve discussed code versioning and style, let’s talk about a practice that can’t be </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.691.1">emphasized enough.</span></span></p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-189"><a id="_idTextAnchor199"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.692.1">Code reviews</span></h1>
<p><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.693.1">Code reviews</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.694.1">, often </span><a id="_idIndexMarker762"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.695.1">also called </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.696.1">peer reviews</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.697.1">, are a very powerful tool for </span><a id="_idIndexMarker763"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.698.1">developers’ daily work. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.698.2">We could almost say that they are fundamental, but the truth is that under certain conditions, it is possible to choose whether to perform them or not, provided, however, that if not, other methodologies are implemented. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.698.3">But let’s go in order and try to understand what a code </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.699.1">review is.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.700.1">A code review can be implemented in slightly different forms, but it typically consists of submitting a piece of code to one or more developers who did not write that code; these people are usually referred to as “reviewers.” </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.700.2">So, for example, if you own a certain task and you developed the relative code, before deploying it in production (or usually even before merging your feature branch on your main branch, depending on your “framework”), your code is reviewed by some other teammate who did not write a single line of that code. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.700.3">The aim is not to judge and the benefits </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.701.1">are vast.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.702.1">First of all, there is a sort of quality assurance. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.702.2">It allows developers to catch and rectify defects, bugs, and vulnerabilities in the code before it reaches the end users. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.702.3">By detecting issues early in the development process, code review significantly reduces the cost and effort required to fix them in later stages of development or </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.703.1">after deployment.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.704.1">Beyond catching bugs, code review can also reveal design flaws and inefficiencies in the code. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.704.2">By discussing and suggesting improvements during code review, developers can refine the software’s architecture, making it more robust </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.705.1">and scalable.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.706.1">Maybe even more important – but this is arguable – is knowledge sharing. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.706.2">Code review is a learning opportunity </span><a id="_idIndexMarker764"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.707.1">for all team members. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.707.2">It promotes knowledge sharing and mentorship, where experienced developers can guide less experienced ones. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.707.3">This collaborative aspect fosters a culture of continuous learning and improvement within the </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.708.1">development team.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.709.1">Code review ensures that the code adheres to a consistent coding style and follows the project’s coding guidelines. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.709.2">This consistency makes the code base more maintainable and understandable, especially when multiple developers are working on the same project. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.709.3">Remember, your code is only clean if everyone on the team thinks </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.710.1">it is!</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.711.1">Then comes one of my favorite aspects: that code review encourages effective communication within the development team. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.711.2">Developers engage in discussions about the code, which can lead to a better understanding of the project’s goals and requirements, resulting in a more aligned and cohesive team. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.711.3">This, in my opinion, also encourages a culture of feedback, which is crucial within companies and teams; it is one of the moments in which we learn to communicate our feedback effectively and, above all, in which we learn to receive it, appreciating it for what it is – that is, a gift to our professional growth. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.711.4">Trust the touchy-feely – the code review is one of the most </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.712.1">learned moments.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.713.1">A code review becomes more effective if you set some sort of rules, I dare almost say limits to what you are going to observe: are we looking for inefficiencies, are we trying to make the code cleaner, are we looking for bugs, are we doing all these things? </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.713.2">No problem, just agree and set expectations. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.713.3">Keep code review sessions short and sweet. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.713.4">Decide on what works for your team, such as maybe sticking to a rule of not going over 1 hour or reviewing more than 200 lines of code at a time. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.713.5">This keeps </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.714.1">things productive.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.715.1">As much as possible, use tools and automation. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.715.2">For example, tools such as GitHub help us with code reviews, with the ability to compare different versions of code, write comments, and more. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.715.3">Automatic tools for static code analysis, which were already addressed in the previous chapters, allow us – if integrated into pipelines, for example – to avoid the most common inaccuracies such as the organization of imports, code formatting, and </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.716.1">so on.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.717.1">Again, the human factor is fundamental. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.717.2">Try to be constructive in giving feedback and try to be “open-minded” in receiving it; it’s not a race, it’s a cooperation between equals. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.717.3">The goal must only be to achieve a common result and to do it together. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.717.4">Code review should be a constructive process, not a blame game. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.717.5">Use polite language and provide suggestions for improvement rather than criticizing the author. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.717.6">The goal is to enhance the code, not demotivate the developer. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.717.7">Make sure everyone on your team, whether they’re new or experienced, takes part in code reviews. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.717.8">It helps newer team members learn about the code and allows them to have their work checked by more experienced developers. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.717.9">This way, the workload can be balanced, and it’s easier to manage when someone is absent or leaves </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.718.1">the team.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.719.1">Sometimes, appointing a moderator or lead developer to facilitate the code review process can be a key element in maintaining its effectiveness. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.719.2">They serve as a guiding force, ensuring that the </span><a id="_idIndexMarker765"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.720.1">review discussions stay productive and on track. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.720.2">The moderator’s responsibilities encompass structuring the review process, clarifying expectations for both authors and reviewers, mediating discussions, and balancing feedback. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.720.3">They also play a vital role in prioritizing issues, documenting outcomes, and mentoring </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.721.1">less-experienced developers.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.722.1">To be honest, there are also some disadvantages in code reviews – that is why they’re sometimes not well-seen by </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.723.1">tech-illiterate managers.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.724.1">The review process has the potential to extend the time it takes to release a software update. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.724.2">This delay occurs because reviewers and authors must collaborate to address issues, which can be time-consuming. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.724.3">Furthermore, reviewers may not be able to expedite the review process due to their existing workload. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.724.4">However, this hurdle can be mitigated through the utilization of code review tools equipped with automated testing capabilities. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.724.5">These tools effectively identify common errors, thereby freeing up valuable developer time that can be redirected toward tackling more complex software </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.725.1">engineering challenges.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.726.1">Developers often find themselves juggling a substantial workload, and the need for a code review can divert their attention from other critical tasks that demand their immediate attention. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.726.2">This diversion poses a dilemma for team members who must choose between completing their ongoing responsibilities or pausing their work to conduct a code review. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.726.3">In either scenario, work somewhere within the organization is delayed. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.726.4">To alleviate this issue, team members can implement strategies such as a reviewer rotation system or maintain a list of domain experts who can share the reviewing burden. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.726.5">These measures prevent any single developer from becoming overwhelmed by a multitude of </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.727.1">review requests.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.728.1">When developers are </span><a id="_idIndexMarker766"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.729.1">tasked with reviewing a substantial code alteration, the review process tends to consume a considerable amount of time. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.729.2">Assessing large code changes can be particularly challenging, and reviewers may feel compelled to expedite the process to meet deadlines, potentially compromising the quality of feedback. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.729.3">An effective solution to this challenge is the practice of incremental code development. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.729.4">This approach allows reviewers to examine smaller code segments multiple times, as opposed to grappling with a massive code change all at once. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.729.5">This not only enhances the quality of the review but also streamlines the </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.730.1">overall process.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.731.1">There are different types of code reviews, which we will list in order of effectiveness, starting with the one that we think is the </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.732.1">least effective.</span></span></p>

<p><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.734.1">Email pass-arounds</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.735.1"> are a common way of dealing with small issues and tiny bits of code. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.735.2">You can do this by sending emails or using code tools. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.735.3">In an email pass-around, the person who </span><a id="_idIndexMarker767"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.736.1">made the code changes sends an email to </span><a id="_idIndexMarker768"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.737.1">those who need to check it. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.737.2">It’s like looking at someone’s screen over their shoulder, and it’s quite easy to use. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.737.3">You don’t need a lot of training, and you can start right away. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.737.4">Of course, think of “email” as “a direct message to someone…” I mean, who uses email to communicate with their teammates nowadays?! </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.737.5">It can, of course, be a Slack message, or a “merge request” on </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.738.1">GitLab... </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.738.2">anything.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.739.1">The advantages of using email pass-arounds include ease of setup, remote and asynchronous review possibilities, and automatic reviews in some code </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.740.1">management systems.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.741.1">However, there are drawbacks to email pass-arounds, such as the time it takes to collect necessary files, difficulty in tracking and following conversations within email threads, the absence of a definite end date for the review, uncertainty about whether the changes were implemented, and challenges in measuring its effectiveness. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.741.2">In all honesty, I found references to this practice only “in literature;” I’ve never seen </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.742.1">it happen.</span></span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-191"><a id="_idTextAnchor201"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.743.1">Code review automation tools</span></h2>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.744.1">Teams sometimes </span><a id="_idIndexMarker769"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.745.1">use automated tools to save time and ensure they deliver high-quality code. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.745.2">These tools can automatically collect and display code changes, streamline feedback through comments, and even help find and fix vulnerabilities using </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.746.1">static application security </span></strong><span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.747.1">testing</span></strong></span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.748.1"> (</span></span><span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.749.1">SAST</span></strong></span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.750.1">).</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.751.1">Think of </span><a id="_idIndexMarker770"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.752.1">these tool-assisted reviews as a valuable addition to other review methods. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.752.2">They help maintain coding standards, identify vulnerabilities, collect data efficiently, and streamline the review process. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.752.3">However, some teams might be tempted to rely solely on these tools and skip involving team members in code reviews. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.752.4">It’s crucial to view these tools as enhancements to the process rather </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.753.1">than replacements.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.754.1">Tool-assisted reviews can simplify data collection and metrics, and free up developers to focus on their work. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.754.2">There are some disadvantages, too, that rely on the developer’s need to manage and maintain the tools – some tools are often really expensive and do not completely remove the necessity of a </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.755.1">human review.</span></span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-192"><a id="_idTextAnchor202"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.756.1">In-person (or remote) teamwork reviews</span></h2>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.757.1">In these reviews, two developers work together, either in person or through a shared screen online. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.757.2">One developer is the author who made the code changes, and the other is the reviewer. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.757.3">The </span><a id="_idIndexMarker771"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.758.1">author explains the changes they </span><a id="_idIndexMarker772"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.759.1">made and why they chose those solutions. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.759.2">The reviewer asks questions and gives suggestions, kind of like how team members work together when pairing. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.759.3">The author can make small changes during the review and note bigger fixes </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.760.1">for later.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.761.1">Advantages are pretty straightforward: in-person meetings (sometimes, they’re also called over-the-shoulder reviews) are easy to set up and complete, and of course, can be done remotely. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.761.2">They’re quicker than pair programming (which we’ll delve into in </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.762.1">a minute).</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.763.1">However, it can happen that the reviewer may not be as connected to the code; in this case, a lot of time would be needed to explain the background and all of the nitty-gritty of the code – or, even worse, the review would be done hastily, quicker than necessary. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.763.2">In this context, there could be some lack of objectivity; without knowing the context (basically, all the code under review just “rained” over the reviewer’s head), you can’t be sure that </span><a id="_idIndexMarker773"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.764.1">all the needed implementations were made. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.764.2">In </span><a id="_idIndexMarker774"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.765.1">general, it’s tricky to understand how well the code </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.766.1">is doing.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.767.1">Now, we’re getting to what we think is the most effective review technique, even though it’s not entirely a review technique. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.767.2">Pair programming is a lot more </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.768.1">than that.</span></span></p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-193"><a id="_idTextAnchor203"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.769.1">Pair programming</span></h1>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.770.1">Perhaps it is simplistic to talk about pair programming as a mere code review technique, but this is just the </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.771.1">starting point.</span></span></p>
<p><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.772.1">Pair programming</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.773.1"> is a software </span><a id="_idIndexMarker775"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.774.1">development technique that requires each feature to be created by a pair of programmers, working on the same workstation (also, consider being able to do it remotely by sharing the screen). </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.774.2">A person writes the code and is called the driver; the other, the navigator, makes a sort of instant revision of every line that is written at the time it is written. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.774.3">The driver focuses on the details of the implementation, while the navigator takes a broader view, reviews the code, and helps </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.775.1">with problem-solving.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.776.1">It is a very powerful technique that has many advantages and – inevitably – some disadvantages. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.776.2">Let’s get to </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.777.1">know them.</span></span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-194"><a id="_idTextAnchor204"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.778.1">Advantages</span></h2>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.779.1">The quality of the software improves: programmers are led to bring their different experiences together, bringing different points of view and different approaches. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.779.2">Pair programmers work </span><a id="_idIndexMarker776"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.780.1">closely together throughout the development process, discussing design decisions, code structure, and potential improvements in real-time. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.780.2">Having two sets of eyes on the code can lead to cleaner code, fewer bugs, and more robust solutions. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.780.3">What’s best, the navigator can catch errors and suggest improvements as they arise. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.780.4">Two minds working together often lead to more creative and effective problem-solving. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.780.5">Programmers can bounce ideas off each other and explore different solutions. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.780.6">Since code is reviewed in real-time, it’s more likely that issues are spotted and corrected before they become major problems, reducing the debugging and </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.781.1">maintenance effort.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.782.1">Another immediate advantage is knowledge sharing. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.782.2">Pair programming helps distribute knowledge and expertise among team members (or even among members of different teams, who are working together to bring in their respective knowledge). </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.782.3">It’s an effective way to transfer skills and best practices from more experienced developers to less experienced ones. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.782.4">Pair programming can be more powerful than any </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.783.1">knowledge-sharing session.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.784.1">Also, to be considered is a certain element of team building and improvement of communication in </span><a id="_idIndexMarker777"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.785.1">general within the team. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.785.2">By collaborating closely, you can hone all those soft skills needed in your daily work with other people and maybe even your </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.786.1">feedback culture.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.787.1">Moreover, pair programming increases focus – it significantly boosts focus by minimizing distractions. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.787.2">The shared responsibility between the “driver” and “navigator” fosters a concentrated mindset, reducing the likelihood of drifting. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.787.3">This collaborative approach ensures constant code review and real-time communication, creating an environment where both individuals are actively engaged in problem-solving. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.787.4">In essence, pair programming not only deters distractions but actively cultivates a focused and productive development atmosphere. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.787.5">Something may change when pair programming is done from a remote location, but not </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.788.1">that much.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.789.1">One factor to consider is the level of seniority of the two programmers, both in general and on the individual task. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.789.2">For example, pairing two experienced developers could be the right choice to boost productivity. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.789.3">A pair made by two novice developers is unlikely to happen, even if it could bring some problems, given my lack of what we could call a “role model.” </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.789.4">Anyway, it’s still better than two novice programmers working independently. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.789.5">The expert-novice pair is one of the most common; this kind of pairing can foster the introduction of fresh ideas as less experienced individuals are often more inclined to question established practices. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.789.6">Simultaneously, the experts, while being asked to clarify established methods, are encouraged to reevaluate them. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.789.7">Nonetheless, within this pairing dynamic, a novice who feels intimidated might become a passive observer, hesitating to actively engage. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.789.8">Similarly, certain experts may lack the patience necessary to facilitate productive participation from novices. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.789.9">Some refer to this phenomenon as “watch </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.790.1">the master.”</span></span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-195"><a id="_idTextAnchor205"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.791.1">Disadvantages</span></h2>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.792.1">The first disadvantage – perhaps the most obvious one, and the one that your tech-illiterate manager might argue with – is that with pair programming, you have two people doing the work of one. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.792.2">If this is not true (we have previously seen all the advantages and </span><a id="_idIndexMarker778"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.793.1">peculiarities of pair programming, in which the roles are distinct and several jobs are carried out at the same time) it is true that pair programming is resource-intensive as you have two programmers who take care of the same task. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.793.2">In a world where there are never enough developers to do all the work, this could be a problem </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.794.1">to address.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.795.1">It is also undeniable that the code will be ready in a longer time; if two people take care of the same task, it is obvious that the “busy” tasks will be fewer in absolute number. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.795.2">In the case of very tight deadlines, this could be </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.796.1">a problem.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.797.1">It would be better, then, to balance the level of seniority of the two programmers involved so as not to create “watch the master” situations or excessive tutoring of a </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.798.1">junior resource.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.799.1">In our opinion, pair programming needs to be properly modulated. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.799.2">Not all tasks are suitable for pair programming. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.799.3">Let’s imagine a repetitive task without too much-added value, something that is not complicated from any point of view – it is just very long. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.799.4">The added value that a possible driver can give would be very small; in that case, it would be much better, in our opinion, to opt for a classic “delayed” code </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.800.1">review process.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.801.1">Moreover, pair programming might not be for everybody: some people just don’t get along, or others prefer to work individually. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.801.2">In this case, it’s better not to force the hand on this practice, or start with short sessions (let’s say, an hour </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.802.1">or so).</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.803.1">I have used pair programming a lot in my career, and I must point out that it has also happened that some colleagues did not feel suitable for pair programming, especially in contexts where the percentage of time for which this practice is carried out is greater than individual programming. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.803.2">Some people prefer to work alone, perhaps exploring freely, following only the logical thread of their thoughts and perhaps converging with teammates only later. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.803.3">The humble advice we would like to give in these cases is not to force the hand with pair programming or in any case to agree at a team level – as trivial as it may be, I think it is the only thing that can work in </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.804.1">this case.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.805.1">A very interesting paper about the costs and benefits of pair programming can be found in the </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.806.1">Further </span></em><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.807.1">reading</span></em></span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.808.1"> section.</span></span></p>

<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.810.1">Pair programming is hard. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.810.2">You have to be extremely focused, especially – I would say – in the role of </span><a id="_idIndexMarker779"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.811.1">the navigator. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.811.2">Pair programming can be both exhausting and fulfilling. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.811.3">Typically, most programmers can only effectively pair for about 5 to 6 hours a day. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.811.4">Therefore, it’s important to schedule breaks and regularly switch pairs. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.811.5">There are many ways in which you can manage your pair; in the following sections, we’ll see some </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.812.1">of them.</span></span></p>

<li><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.832.1">In the role of the navigator, refrain from getting lost in the immediate tactical details of coding since the driver focuses on those. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.832.2">Your responsibility is to step back and complement your partner’s tactical approach with medium-term thinking. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.832.3">Jot down upcoming tasks, potential roadblocks, and ideas on sticky notes. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.832.4">Discuss them after the completion of the current tiny goal to avoid disrupting the </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.833.1">driver’s workflow.</span></span></li>

<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.864.1">This method </span><a id="_idIndexMarker789"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.865.1">can be integrated with most of the pairing approaches mentioned, helping maintain focus. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.865.2">Pair programming can be tiring, so having prompts for breaks and switching roles </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.866.1">is beneficial.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.867.1">The Pomodoro </span><a id="_idIndexMarker790"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.868.1">technique is a time management method that was developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.868.2">It’s designed to help people enhance productivity and maintain focus. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.868.3">For all the non-Italian speakers out there: “</span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.869.1">Pomodoro</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.870.1">” means “</span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.871.1">tomato</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.872.1">” and it refers to a simple Pomodoro-shaped </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.873.1">kitchen timer.</span></span></p>

<ol>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.877.1">Set a timer</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.878.1">: Choose a task you want to work on. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.878.2">Set a timer for 25 minutes, which is called one “Pomodoro.” </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.878.3">During this time, you commit to working on the task with </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.879.1">full concentration.</span></span></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.880.1">Work intensely</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.881.1">: While the timer is running, work on your task with focused, undivided attention. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.881.2">Avoid distractions, such as checking your phone or email. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.881.3">I’m not saying that you should also ignore calls from your wife, but it’s strongly recommended; to use this book as </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.882.1">an excuse.</span></span></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.883.1">Take a short break</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.884.1">: When the timer rings after 25 minutes, take a short 5-minute break. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.884.2">Use this time to relax, stretch, or do something unrelated to work. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.884.3">It’s a brief reward for your </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.885.1">focused effort.</span></span></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.886.1">Repeat</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.887.1">: After the short break, go back to another 25-minute Pomodoro session. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.887.2">Keep repeating these cycles of work and </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.888.1">short breaks.</span></span></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.889.1">Longer break</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.890.1">: After completing four Pomodoro sessions (totaling 2 hours of work), take a longer break of 15-30 minutes. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.890.2">Use this time to recharge and plan your </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.891.1">next tasks.</span></span></li>
</ol>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.892.1">The Pomodoro technique aims to leverage the benefits of focused, concentrated work while preventing burnout. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.892.2">It encourages you to break your work into smaller, manageable chunks with built-in breaks. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.892.3">This method can help improve time management, reduce procrastination, and boost overall productivity. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.892.4">It’s particularly useful for tasks that require deep concentration, not only programming; we think it should be taught </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.893.1">at school.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.894.1">The Pomodoro </span><a id="_idIndexMarker792"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.895.1">technique can be used to manage pair programming sessions; whenever a Pomodoro ends, the driver and navigator switch roles. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.895.2">You decide if this technique is good or if it is too “rigid.” </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.895.3">These and all the others are just suggestions – it’s up to you to find the right size and the right pace </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.896.1">of work.</span></span></p>

<p><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.906.1">Requirements documentation</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.907.1"> is where you define what the software should be like. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.907.2">It’s like the building plan for </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.908.1">the software.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.909.1">Requirements </span><a id="_idIndexMarker794"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.910.1">documentation in software development is like making a detailed wish list or set of instructions for what a new piece </span><a id="_idIndexMarker795"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.911.1">of software should do. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.911.2">It’s a way to precisely define and describe what the software needs to achieve and how it should behave. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.911.3">This documentation outlines the features, functions, and qualities the software should have to meet the needs of its users or </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.912.1">the business.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.913.1">This documentation is crucial because it acts as a guide for the software developers. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.913.2">It helps them understand the expectations and goals set by the clients or stakeholders. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.913.3">Think of it as a blueprint that details the foundation and boundaries within which the software will be designed, built, and tested. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.913.4">Requirements documentation is like drawing a map that shows the path for building the right software that fulfills specific needs and functions </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.914.1">as intended.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.915.1">Requirements documentation is a phase that comes after the collection and analysis phases. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.915.2">I refer you to the </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.916.1">Further reading</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.917.1"> section for more in-depth information. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.917.2">Once gathered, it’s uncommon for requirements to be simply written in a lengthy and formal textual document. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.917.3">According to our experience, what happens more often is that spreadsheets </span><a id="_idIndexMarker796"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.918.1">or specialized tools are used. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.918.2">If spreadsheets are used, each requirement is typically represented by a row, and each attribute of </span><a id="_idIndexMarker797"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.919.1">the requirements, such as an ID, a description, a priority, a reporter, and so on, is represented by a column. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.919.2">The same information, and often much more, is managed through specific software for “issue tracking,” such as Jira or Redmine. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.919.3">Requirements documentation then becomes the collection of information – the issues – stored in these tools. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.919.4">It’s widely used, especially in Agile </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.920.1">development frameworks.</span></span></p>

<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1024.1">Swagger offers several key benefits, apart from the documentation itself: it can also generate client and server code in various programming languages, reducing the effort needed to integrate with the API. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1024.2">A very useful feature is that it includes tools for testing and </span><a id="_idIndexMarker817"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1025.1">debugging APIs, making it easier to identify and resolve issues. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1025.2">Last but not least, Swagger uses the </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1026.1">OpenAPI Specification</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1027.1"> (formerly </span><a id="_idIndexMarker818"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1028.1">known as the </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1029.1">Swagger Specification</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1030.1">), a widely adopted standard for describing RESTful APIs. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1030.2">This promotes consistency and interoperability among different systems </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1031.1">and developers.</span></span></p>

<li><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1102.1">Spring REST Docs processes these tests and generates documentation based on the test results. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1102.2">It can generate documentation in various formats, such as AsciiDoc, Markdown, or HTML. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1102.3">This is a very cool thing: documentation is kept up-to-date in case of changes in </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1103.1">the code.</span></span></li>

<h2 id="_idParaDest-202"><a id="_idTextAnchor212"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1111.1">Good practices for documentation</span></h2>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1112.1">Writing and </span><a id="_idIndexMarker836"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1113.1">maintaining documentation is fundamental yet hard. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1113.2">Doing it the right way is not very common – not at all! </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1113.3">– and will take your team to the next level. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1113.4">Here’s some advice based on our experience and also on </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1114.1">our mistakes.</span></span></p>
<h3><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1115.1">Incorporate documentation into the development flow</span></h3>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1116.1">One common reason software teams skip documentation is that they’re always waiting for that </span><a id="_idIndexMarker837"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1117.1">perfect moment when they have loads of free time. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1117.2">But let’s face it – in the fast-paced world of software, that moment rarely arrives with all the new projects and initiatives on </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1118.1">the horizon.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1119.1">So, here’s the hack: make documentation a natural part of your design process. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1119.2">Think of it as a crucial step that’s part of the whole deal, not some extra task you squeeze in later. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1119.3">Sure, it might add a bit more time, but that extra effort will pay off when you need to handle or expand your system down the road. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1119.4">Plus, your team will be all set to tackle those unexpected curveballs </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1120.1">like pros.</span></span></p>
<h3><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1121.1">Write comprehensive documentation</span></h3>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1122.1">Comprehensive documentation for your software architecture is an absolute must for ensuring </span><a id="_idIndexMarker838"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1123.1">the seamless maintenance and expansion of your systems. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1123.2">This documentation functions as a valuable resource, particularly when crucial members of your engineering team move on, safeguarding essential knowledge from being lost. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1123.3">Moreover, it streamlines the process of conveying vital information about the system to a diverse range </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1124.1">of stakeholders.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1125.1">While there may be those who argue that code alone suffices as documentation (I would agree with that, actually, but only if you add the adjective “good” to the word “code”), it is vital to acknowledge that comprehensive documentation offers invaluable context for decision-making and is accessible to both technical and </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1126.1">non-technical stakeholders.</span></span></p>
<h3><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1127.1">Up-to-date documentation</span></h3>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1128.1">Maintaining up-to-date documentation is essential as outdated documentation can lead to the </span><a id="_idIndexMarker839"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1129.1">same issues as having no documentation at all. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1129.2">Documentation that accurately reflects the current state of the system is crucial to ensure informed decision-making and to prevent critical errors caused by referencing outdated information during updates </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1130.1">or changes.</span></span></p>
<h3><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1131.1">Tailored documentation for specific audiences</span></h3>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1132.1">Customizing software architecture documentation to cater to specific audiences is essential. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1132.2">Not all stakeholders have the same information requirements, and attempting to fit all </span><a id="_idIndexMarker840"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1133.1">the details into a single document can hinder the ease of finding information. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1133.2">It might even discourage individuals from using the </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1134.1">documentation altogether.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1135.1">To ensure the effectiveness of documentation, it’s crucial to provide the appropriate level of context for the intended audience. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1135.2">For instance, business executives may not require in-depth technical and code details, whereas engineers may find it challenging to fulfill their responsibilities without access to such </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1136.1">technical specifics.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1137.1">We can give you all the advice in the world, and guide you toward all the best practices possible, but unfortunately, we must acknowledge that these good habits are sometimes unwelcome to non-technical individuals. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1137.2">In the next section, we’ll have a chat </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1138.1">about it.</span></span></p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-203"><a id="_idTextAnchor213"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1139.1">A hard dose of reality</span></h1>

<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1142.1">However, we must tell you something undeniable – sometimes, some of these practices can cause disagreements between tech-savvy and non-tech-savvy people. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1142.2">What we’ve noticed is that there’s often a very different view of how work is organized, especially in terms of tasks. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1142.3">Of course, even the concept of code quality may not matter at all to certain managers or partners who are not used to writing code. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1142.4">But let’s go step </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1143.1">by step.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1144.1">For example, pair programming can be seen by management as resource-intensive because it requires two developers to work on the same task, potentially increasing labor costs. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1144.2">It could also be because the target is arguably more long-term. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1144.3">However, management often prioritizes short-term project goals, such as meeting deadlines and immediate deliverables, which may not align with the collaborative nature of pair programming. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1144.4">The benefits of pair programming, such as improved code quality and reduced defects, often manifest in the long term. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1144.5">However, these benefits may not be immediately visible to management, which can lead to skepticism. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1144.6">In general, there could also be a simple lack of familiarity: some managers may not be familiar with the practice and may be hesitant to introduce a process they don’t fully understand. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1144.7">Also, introducing pair programming may disrupt established workflows within the organization, leading to resistance </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1145.1">from management.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1146.1">Documentation also suffers some of these perceived fears. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1146.2">Why stop documenting something that is already working? </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1146.3">Why not go ahead and do another task instead? </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1146.4">Some managers may not fully understand the importance of documentation in terms of reducing errors, enhancing collaboration, and easing onboarding of new team members. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1146.5">This lack of understanding can lead to underestimating its value. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1146.6">Also, some managers may perceive the time spent on documentation as time that could be used for more coding or direct project work, potentially leading to underutilization of </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1147.1">developer resources.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1148.1">Between the two, I have to say that pair programming is the practice that meets more resistance, at least from my point of view. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1148.2">All the practices that we’ve covered in this chapter are important, but getting along is also crucial! </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1148.3">Try to introduce all of these practices or at least some pieces of them; try to adapt, try to prioritize. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1148.4">To address concerns, developers, and management can engage in open communication to explain the long-term advantages of pair programming, documentation, and so on, how they can improve code quality and project quality, reduce defects, and enhance knowledge sharing. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1148.5">They can also discuss how it can lead to faster problem-solving and overall efficiency in the development process. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1148.6">Management can work to strike a balance between immediate project needs and the long-term benefits of </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1149.1">such practices.</span></span></p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-204"><a id="_idTextAnchor214"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1150.1">The importance of knowing what you’re doing</span></h1>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1151.1">In this more informal part of this chapter, we want to offer one last piece of advice about the things you do every day. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1151.2">It’s not just a technical tip; it’s more like advice from a friend, something I wish someone had told me when I started </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1152.1">my career.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1153.1">When you work on a project, a task, or anything else, always keep in mind why you chose to do it. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1153.2">Ask yourself, “Why am I doing this?” </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1153.3">It’s not just about staying motivated; there’s more to it </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1154.1">than that.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1155.1">First of all, this will help you avoid feeling like a random monkey hitting keys on a keyboard. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1155.2">It will also help you understand how your work contributes to the development of a project or a company. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1155.3">Having clear goals for your work, whether they’re short-term, medium-term, or long-term, will keep you focused on your task without getting distracted by other things. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1155.4">If your work has a specific purpose, and even better, if that purpose is something you believe in, your productivity will increase, and your work will </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1156.1">be better.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1157.1">Knowing why you’re doing something, and understanding the purpose behind it, will lead to better decision-making. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1157.2">When faced with doubts or uncertainties, having a clear goal in mind will guide your choices and prevent future disappointments. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1157.3">When we have detailed plans for specific actions at both upcoming milestones and our ultimate goals, every decision appears to </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1158.1">align seamlessly.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1159.1">One of the decisions you’ll have to make includes prioritizing your tasks within a project. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1159.2">Should you do one thing before the other? </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1159.3">Which task will take more time compared to the value it will generate? </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1159.4">Well, if you know what you’re doing – in other words, if you have a clear goal – this will likely assist your decision-making and set a smoother path toward </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1160.1">project completion.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1161.1">If you know your goal, you can probably also understand how far you are from reaching it. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1161.2">In other words, knowing your “why” helps you measure your progress. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1161.3">Imagine a team or a developer who is simply told to do something, completely disconnected from the context, something like “Write a method that returns this output given this input” – I don’t think this happens much after school, but let’s say it does. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1161.4">This person wouldn’t have the slightest idea of how their work is contributing and where they stand on the journey toward the final goal. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1161.5">This person would do a </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1162.1">worse job.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1163.1">In a book on refactoring, it’s important to mention that understanding the “why” behind things helps in writing better code and, when necessary, refactoring it more effectively. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1163.2">Writing down the reasons for doing something, perhaps in a comment alongside complex code, can assist developers in rewriting it more efficiently. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1163.3">This, along with good test coverage and everything we’ve already discussed in the previous chapters, greatly aids both the comprehension of the current code and any potential </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1164.1">rewriting efforts.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1165.1">Ask questions, and keep asking yourself and others. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1165.2">If you’re in a position where a manager or a partner is guiding you on task prioritization – for instance, if you work within a framework that involves a product owner – always ask why one thing is chosen over another. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1165.3">What benefits will it bring? </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1165.4">How much will it cost, and how much will it earn for the company? </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1165.5">Is there data to support this decision? </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1165.6">I’m not saying to start a war, absolutely not, but always try to “challenge” your colleagues in </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1166.1">this sense.</span></span></p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-205"><a id="_idTextAnchor215"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1167.1">Summary</span></h1>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1168.1">In this chapter, we tried to provide you with some advice on introducing small but significant changes that will greatly benefit your work. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1168.2">We explored how you can version your code and offered some branching models that the community has found effective over the years. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1168.3">Versioning your code is important, but let’s version beautiful code! </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1168.4">We discussed how code reviews can be helpful and how to incorporate them into your everyday work. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1168.5">We dedicated an entire section to a particular form of code review, which is pair programming. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1168.6">We also delved into documentation, distinguishing between various types and providing guidance, especially for technical documentation of REST APIs. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1168.7">Lastly, we addressed the real-world implementation of these practices, which can sometimes face resistance, particularly in medium to </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1169.1">small-sized companies.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1170.1">In the next chapter, we’ll take a step back and discuss how these various elements communicate with each other. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1170.2">We’ll talk about best practices, identify issues (bad smells), and provide some advice on refactoring </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1171.1">your architectures.</span></span></p>
