- en: This book is designed to help you learn how to program games and other interactive
    applications quickly using a learn-by-doing approach. Unlike other texts, which
    start with a detailed description of all aspects of a language or development
    platform, we will only cover exactly what is needed for the task at hand. As you
    progress through the book, your programming skill and ability will grow as you
    learn topics such as animation, collision detection, artificial intelligence,
    and game design. Project-based learning is a proven approach and becoming prominent
    in primary, secondary, and higher education. It enhances the learning process
    and improves knowledge retention.

- en: The topics presented in this book closely follow the ones I cover in my game
    design class. Through years of teaching this material, I have found that a project-based
    learning approach can quickly get students successfully programming and creating
    interesting games and applications. I hope that you too will be amazed with how
    much you can accomplish in a short amount of time.

    programming languages in the world and is widely used in the finance industry,
    gaming companies, and research institutions. We will be doing our programming
    in Greenfoot ([www.greenfoot.org](http://www.greenfoot.org))—an interactive Java
    development environment. This environment allows both novice and experienced programmers
    to quickly create visually appealing applications. It provides a safe environment
    for experimentation and allows you to share your work on a variety of platforms.

- en: '[Chapter 1](part0014.xhtml "Chapter 1. Let''s Dive Right in…"), *Let''s Dive
    Right in…*, takes you through a complete tutorial for creating a simple game complete
    with an introduction screen, game over screen, a score, mouse input, and sound.
    This tutorial serves the purpose of introducing you to Greenfoot basics, Java
    basics, and good programming practices.'

- en: '[Chapter 2](part0017.xhtml "Chapter 2. Animation"), *Animation*, discusses
    how to perform animation in Greenfoot. Animation requires appropriate and well-timed
    image swapping as well as realistic movement around the screen. After reading
    the given topic and seeing an example, you will apply learned animation techniques
    to the game you created in [Chapter 1](part0014.xhtml "Chapter 1. Let''s Dive
    Right in…"), *Let''s Dive Right in…*.'

- en: '[Chapter 3](part0024.xhtml "Chapter 3. Collision Detection"), *Collision Detection*,
    discusses why collision detection is necessary for most simulations and games.
    You will learn how to use Greenfoot''s built-in collision detection mechanisms
    and then learn more accurate methods to do collision detection. You will use both
    border-based and hidden-sprite methods of collision detection to create a zombie
    invasion simulation.'

- en: '[Chapter 4](part0030.xhtml "Chapter 4. Projectiles"), *Projectiles*, talks
    about how actors in creative Greenfoot often have movement that can best be described
    as *being launched*. A soccer ball, bullet, laser, light ray, baseball, and firework
    are examples of this type of object. You will learn how to implement this type
    of propelled movement. You will also learn how gravity, if present, affects it
    by working through the implementation of a comprehensive platform game.'

- en: '[Chapter 5](part0034.xhtml "Chapter 5. Interactive Application Design and Theory"),
    *Interactive Application Design and Theory*, discusses creating engaging and immersive
    experiences in Greenfoot, which is far more involved than compiling a collection
    of programming effects into one application. In this chapter, you will learn how
    to engage your user by understanding the relationship between user choice and
    outcome, conditioning the user, and including the right level of complexity into
    your work. You will be shown a proven iterative development process that helps
    you put the theory into practice.'

    and Mapped Worlds*, discusses how to create worlds that are much more extensive
    than the ones that can fit into the confines of a single screen. At the beginning
    of the chapter, you will code a scrolling exploration game and by the end of the
    chapter you will expand it into a large mapped game.'

    Intelligence*, talks about how AI, despite being a deep and complex topic, has
    some simple techniques you can learn to give the illusion of having intelligent,
    autonomous actors in your worlds. First, you will learn how to effectively use
    random behaviors. Next, you will implement simple heuristics to simulate intelligent
    behavior. Last, you will learn the A* search algorithm to allow game actors to
    intelligently bypass obstacles when moving between two locations on the screen.'

    a heads-up display.'

    how to set up Greenfoot to work with it. You will then add gamepad support to
    the game we created in [Chapter 1](part0014.xhtml "Chapter 1. Let''s Dive Right
    in…"), *Let''s Dive Right in…*, and [Chapter 2](part0017.xhtml "Chapter 2. Animation"),

    during the course of this book. I then go on to suggest projects you should attempt
    in order to continue your journey as a programmer and interactive application
    author.'
