The newer versions of Clojure fortify its performance story while staying close to its roots—simplicity and pragmatism. This edition significantly updates the book for Clojure 1.7, and adds a new chapter on the performance measurement.</p><p>The Java Virtual Machine plays a huge role in the performance of the Clojure programs. This edition of the book increases the focus on the JVM tools for performance management, and it explores how to use those. This book is updated to use Java 8, though it also highlights the places where features from Java 7 or 8 have been used.</p><p>This book is updated mainly to be more of practical use to the readers. I hope that this edition will better equip the readers with performance measurement and profiling tools and with the know-how of analyzing and tuning the performance characteristics of Clojure code.</p><div class="section" title="What this book covers"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl1sec02"/>What this book covers</h1></div></div></div><p>
<a class="link" href="ch01.html" title="Chapter 1. Performance by Design">Chapter 1</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Performance by Design</em></span>, classifies the various use cases with respect to performance, and analyzes how to interpret their performance aspects and needs.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch02.html" title="Chapter 2. Clojure Abstractions">Chapter 2</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Clojure Abstractions</em></span>, is a guided tour of various Clojure data structures, abstractions (persistent data structures, vars, macros, transducers, and so on), and their performance characteristics.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch03.html" title="Chapter 3. Leaning on Java">Chapter 3</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Leaning on Java</em></span>, discusses how to enhance performance by using Java interoperability and features from Clojure.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch04.html" title="Chapter 4. Host Performance">Chapter 4</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Host Performance</em></span>, discusses how the host stack impacts performance. Being a hosted language, Clojure has its performance directly related to the host.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch05.html" title="Chapter 5. Concurrency">Chapter 5</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Concurrency</em></span>, is an advanced chapter that discusses the concurrency and parallelism features in Clojure and JVM. Concurrency is an increasingly significant way to derive performance.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch06.html" title="Chapter 6. Measuring Performance">Chapter 6</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Measuring Performance</em></span>, covers various aspects of performance benchmarks and measuring other factors.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch07.html" title="Chapter 7. Performance Optimization">Chapter 7</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Performance Optimization</em></span>, discusses systematic steps that need to be taken in order to identify that the performance bottlenecks obtain good performance.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch08.html" title="Chapter 8. Application Performance">Chapter 8</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Application Performance</em></span>, discusses building applications for performance. This involves dealing with external subsystems and factors that impact the overall performance.</p></div></div>
<div class="section" title="What you need for this book"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl1sec03"/>What you need for this book</h1></div></div></div><p>You should acquire Java Development Kit version 8 or higher for your operating system to work through all the examples. This book discusses the Oracle HotSpot JVM, so you may want to get Oracle JDK or OpenJDK (or Zulu) if possible. You should also get the latest Leiningen version (2.5.2 as of the time of writing) from <a class="ulink" href="http://leiningen.org/">http://leiningen.org/</a>, and JD-GUI from <a class="ulink" href="http://jd.benow.ca/">http://jd.benow.ca/</a>.</p></div>
<div class="section" title="Who this book is for"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl1sec04"/>Who this book is for</h1></div></div></div><p>This book is for intermediate Clojure programmers who are interested in learning how to write high-performance code. If you are an absolute beginner in Clojure, you should learn the basics of the language first, and then come back to this book. You need not be well-versed in performance engineering or Java. However, some prior knowledge of Java would make it much easier to understand the Java-related chapters.</p></div>
<div class="section" title="Conventions"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl1sec05"/>Conventions</h1></div></div></div><p>In this book, you will find a number of text styles that distinguish between different kinds of information. Here are some examples of these styles and an explanation of their meaning.</p><p>Code words in text, database table names, folder names, filenames, file extensions, pathnames, dummy URLs, user input, and Twitter handles are shown as follows: "Note that <code class="literal">identical?</code> in Clojure is the same as <code class="literal">==</code> in Java."</p><p>A block of code is set as follows:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">user=&gt; (identical? "foo" "foo")  ; literals are automatically interned
true
user=&gt; (identical? (String. "foo") (String. "foo"))  ; created string is not interned
false</pre></div><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>New terms</strong></span> and <span class="strong"><strong>important words</strong></span> are shown in bold. Words that you see on the screen, for example, in menus or dialog boxes, appear in the text like this: "Clicking the <span class="strong"><strong>Next</strong></span> button moves you to the next screen."</p><div class="note" style="" title="Note"><div class="inner"><h3 class="title"><a id="note01"/>Note</h3><p>Warnings or important notes appear in a box like this.</p></div></div><div class="note" style="" title="Note"><div class="inner"><h3 class="title"><a id="tip01"/>Tip</h3><p>Tips and tricks appear like this.</p></div></div></div>
