- en: Nowadays developers are facing competitive pressures and it impacts the way
    they build applications, which includes faster delivery, scalability, and high
    performance. Microservices helps in decomposing applications into small services
    and move away from a single monolithic artifact. In that case, we can build systems
    that are scalable, flexible, and high resilient. Spring Boot helps in building
    such REST-oriented, production-grade microservices.
