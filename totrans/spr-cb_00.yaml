- en: Web development with Java has a high learning curve compared to Ruby on Rails,
    Django, and modern PHP frameworks. Spring, the most used Java framework for web
    development, makes it as easy as it can get, especially with its recent move of
    using plain Java classes instead of XML files for configuration classes for configuration.
    This book focuses on getting you up and running with Spring 4 in the most efficient
    manner.
