    make a landscape of cooperating microservices production ready. As we already
    described in *Chapter 1*, *Introduction to Microservices*, in the *Service discovery*
    section, a service discovery service (or a *discovery service* as an abbreviation)
    can be used to keep track of existing microservices and their instances.

    a microservice, and how requests to a microservice will be load-balanced over
    its available instances (based on, by default, round-robin scheduling).

    in *Chapter 1*, *Introduction to Microservices*, in the *Edge server* section,
    it can be used to secure a microservice landscape, which involves hiding private
    services from external usage and protecting public services when they’re used
    by external clients.

- en: Initially, Spring Cloud used Netflix Zuul v1 as its edge server. Since the Spring
    Cloud Greenwich release, it’s recommended to use **Spring Cloud Gateway** instead.
    Spring Cloud Gateway comes with similar support for critical features, such as
    URL path-based routing and the protection of endpoints via the use of **OAuth
    2.0** and **OpenID Connect** (**OIDC**).
  id: totrans-59
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One important difference between Netflix Zuul v1 and Spring Cloud Gateway is
    that Spring Cloud Gateway is based on non-blocking APIs that use Spring 6, Project
    Reactor, and Spring Boot 3, while Netflix Zuul v1 is based on blocking APIs. This
    means that Spring Cloud Gateway should be able to handle larger numbers of concurrent
    requests than Netflix Zuul v1, which is important for an edge server that all
    external traffic goes through.

- en: Micrometer Tracing can also be used to decorate log records with correlation
    IDs to make it easier to track log records from different microservices that come
    from the same processing flow. **Zipkin** is a distributed tracing system ([http://zipkin.io](http://zipkin.io))
    that Micrometer Tracing can send tracing data to for storage and visualization.
    Later on, in *Chapter 19*, *Centralized Logging with the EFK Stack*, we will learn
    how to find and visualize log records from one and the same processing flow using
    the correlation ID.

- en: The infrastructure for handling distributed tracing information in Micrometer
    Tracing and Zipkin is originally based on Google Dapper ([https://ai.google/research/pubs/pub36356](https://ai.google/research/pubs/pub36356)).
    In Dapper, the tracing information from a complete workflow is called a **trace
    tree**, and subparts of the tree, such as the basic units of work, are called
    **spans**. Spans can, in turn, consist of sub-spans, which form the trace tree.
    A correlation ID is called **TraceId**, and a span is identified by its own unique
    **SpanId**, along with the **TraceId** of the trace tree it belongs to.

    to the **product-composite** service through the gateway (our edge server) and
    it responds by publishing create events to the topics for products, recommendations,
    and reviews. These events are consumed by the three core microservices in parallel
    and asynchronously, meaning that the **product-composite** service does not wait
    for the core microservices to complete their work. The data in the create events
    is stored in each microservice’s database.

    we have seen an example of distributed tracing of the processing of an external
    synchronous HTTP request that includes asynchronous passing of events between
    the involved microservices.

    OSS-centric to having a much larger scope as of today, used together with tools
    including Resilience4j and Micrometer Tracing. We also introduced how components
    from the latest release of Spring Cloud 2022 can be used to implement some of
    the design patterns we described in *Chapter 1*, *Introduction to Microservices*,
    in the *Design patterns for microservices* section. These design patterns are
    required to make a landscape of cooperating microservices production ready.
