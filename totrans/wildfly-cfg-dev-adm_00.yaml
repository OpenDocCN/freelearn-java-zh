- en: WildFly is the new name for the community version of JBoss AS. WildFly is still
    the most popular Java Enterprise server out there. It is easy to use, has a clean
    management interface, a powerful command-line tool, a modular architecture, is
    light, and is lightning quick. If you need product support, it is very easy to
    move from WildFly to JBoss EAP Server and, importantly, the license and support
    costs won't break the bank.

- en: This book gently introduces you to WildFly by looking at how to download and
    install the server. We then move on to look at configuring enterprise services
    and the various subsystems, and securing your server and applications. The topics
    become more advanced as the book progresses, so in the later part of the book,
    we look at high availability, which is achieved through clustering and load balancing.
