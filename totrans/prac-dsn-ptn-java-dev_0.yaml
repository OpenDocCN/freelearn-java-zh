- en: The Java language is a tool for communicating with a very rich platform that
    provides many features ready to serve for application development. This book explores
    the latest developments in improving language syntax with examples of the most
    useful design patterns. The book reveals the relationship between features, patterns,
    and platform efficiency through example implementations. The book explores how
    theoretical foundations help improve the maintainability, efficiency, and testability
    of source code. The content helps the reader solve different tasks and provides
    guidance on how to approach programming challenges using a variety of sustainable
    and transparent approaches.
