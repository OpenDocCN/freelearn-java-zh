The phrase Digital Transformation is yet another buzzword pandered around by business executives. Enterprise Java developers do not have to be afraid of this new digital world, because we are involved in building the most exciting software on this planet. We are building software for users, customers, and people. Replace the word <span class="strong"><em class="calibre9">Digital</em></span> with <span class="strong"><em class="calibre9">User Experience</em></span> and you will instantly get what all the fuss is about.</p><p class="calibre7">So let's remove the marketing terms once and for all. Digital transformation takes a non-online business process and produces the equivalent online version. Of course, a ponderous ugly caterpillar does not suddenly morph into a beautiful Red Admiral butterfly overnight, without life experience and genetics. It takes the considerable skills of developers, designers, and architects to adapt, transform, and apply the business requirements to technology. In recent times, the software profession has recognized the validity of users and their experiences. Essentially, we have matured.</p><p class="calibre7">This book is about developers who can mature and want to mature. These are the developers who can embrace Java technologies and are sympathetic to the relevant web technologies.</p><p class="calibre7">In this chapter, we will start our developer's journey with the requirements of the web developer, engineers at the so-called front-end, and the digital and creative industry. We will survey the enterprise Java platform and ask the question, where does Java fit in? We will look at the growth of JavaScript. We will learn about the Java EE 7 modern web architecture. To conclude, we will finish with a simple JavaServer Faces example.</p><div class="book" title="Working in the digital domain"><div class="book"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h1 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl1sec08" class="calibre1"/>Working in the digital domain</h1></div></div></div><p class="calibre7">Working in a <a id="id0" class="calibre1"/>digital domain requires the business to move beyond legacy and institutionalized thinking.

That strategy was suitable, once upon a time.

<span class="strong"><strong class="calibre8">Digital engineers are smart, professional engineers</strong></span>

Some of my clients have supplied me with badly configured machines. One particular client in finance gave me a Dell Latitude with only 4 GB RAM, running Windows 7 Professional.

Inform the decision makers in your business that digital workers need adequate development machines, fit for the purpose of engineering and designing great user experiences.</p></div><p class="calibre7">Let's switch from creativity and design to the Java platform.</p></div>
<div class="book" title="Java in the picture"><div class="book" id="aid-G6PI2"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h1 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl1sec10" class="calibre1"/>Java in the picture</h1></div></div></div><p class="calibre7">The Java platform is<a id="id3" class="calibre1"/> in widespread use today. It was the first commercial language featuring JVM and byte-code with garbage collection, sandbox security, and <a id="id4" class="calibre1"/>networking capability to be adopted by business. Java's greatest strength is that businesses trust this platform to power enterprise applications in server-side computing. Since 1995, this strength in depth has grown to such a level that the platform is seen as very mature and mainstream. The disadvantage of being part of the main herd is that innovation takes a while to happen; as the steward of the platform, earlier Sun Microsystems and now Oracle Corporation, always guarantee backward compatibility and the maintenance of standards through the Java Community Process.</p><p class="calibre7">The JVM<a id="id5" class="calibre1"/> is the crown jewel of the platform. Java is the mother programming language that runs on the JVM. Other languages such as Scala, Groovy, and Clojure also run the JVM. These alternative JVM languages are popular, because they introduced many functional programming ideas to the mainstream developers. Functional programming primitives such as closures and comprehensions and languages such as Scala demonstrated a pure object-oriented model and mix-ins. These languages benefited from an easy interaction<a id="id6" class="calibre1"/> tool called <span class="strong"><strong class="calibre8">REPL</strong></span>.</p><div class="informalexample" title="Note"><h3 class="title2"><a id="tip03" class="calibre1"/>Tip</h3><p class="calibre7">In fact, Java SE 9 will most likely have <span class="strong"><strong class="calibre8">Read-Evaluate-Print-Loop</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong class="calibre8">REPL</strong></span>). Keep an eye on the progression of the official OpenJDK project Kulla at <a class="calibre1" href="http://openjdk.java.net/projects/kulla/">http://openjdk.java.net/projects/kulla/</a>.</p></div><p class="calibre7">Released in 2014, Java SE 8 features functional interfaces, otherwise known as Lambdas, which bring the<a id="id7" class="calibre1"/> benefits of closures and functional blocks to the main JVM language on the platform.</p><p class="calibre7">Whatever programming language you choose to develop your next enterprise application, Java or Scala or otherwise, I think you can bet on the JVM being around for a long time, at least for the next decade or so. The PermGen issue finally ended in Java SE 8, because there is no permanent generation in there. Before Java SE 8, PermGen was the source of many memory leaks (slow and steady memory hogs). This was also the dedicated space where the JVM would load classes into a piece of memory such as the Java Runtime (such as <code class="email">java.lang.String</code>, <code class="email">java.lang.System</code>, or <code class="email">java.util.collection.ConcurrentHashMap</code>). However, classes were rarely unloaded or compacted in size, especially during a very long execution of a JVM. If you are running websites 24/7 over a number of days or even weeks at a time with some degree of user interaction, then there is a good chance that your applications (and their application server) could run out of memory (<code class="email">java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: PermGen space</code>). The permanent generation was the storage area reserved for internal representation of Java classes in releases before JDK 8. For long running application servers and JVM processes, it was possible for references to metadata and classes to remain in permanent generation memory even after if WAR/EAR applications were undeployed and uninstalled. In Java SE 8, the reserved allocation of memory for the Java classes is adaptive. The JVM can now gracefully manage its own memory allocations and represents at least 10 percent efficiency improvement as compared to the previous versions.</p><p class="calibre7">In Java SE 8, we<a id="id8" class="calibre1"/> have a Garbage First Garbage collector known as G1, which is a parallel collector. Java SE 8 also includes new byte codes to improve the efficiency of dynamic languages such as JRuby and Clojure. The InvokeDynamic byte code from JDK 7 and the Method Handle API were particularly instrumented for the Nashorn, an implementation of JavaScript (ECMAScript Edition 6).</p><div class="informalexample" title="Note"><h3 class="title2"><a id="tip04" class="calibre1"/>Tip</h3><p class="calibre7">As of April 2015, Oracle stopped releasing updates to Java SE 7 to its public download sites. Please pass on this information to your CTO!</p></div><p class="calibre7">There is no<a id="id9" class="calibre1"/> doubt that the Java platform will continually serve digital engineers as a back-end technology. It may even occur to businesses to take advantage of the client-side technology in Java SE 8 that is now delivered with the platform. JavaFX is an interesting solution, but outside the scope of this book.</p><p class="calibre7">We should introduce some code now. The following is a Lambda function for Java SE 8:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">public interface PaymentIssuer {
  public void allocate( int id );
}

@ApplicationScoped
public class CreditCardTicketTracker() {
  // Rely on CDI product factory to inject the correct type
  @Inject PaymentIssuer issuer;
 
  public void processTickets( List&lt;Ticket&gt; ticketBatch ) {
  final LocalDate dt = LocalDate.now().plusDays(2)
    ticketBatch.stream()
      .filter(
        t -&gt; t.isAvailable()  &amp;&amp;
        t -&gt; t.paymentType == PaymentType.CreditCard &amp;&amp;
        dt.isBefore(DateUtils.asLocalDate(
      t.getConcertDate())))
      .map(t -&gt; t.getAllocation().allocateToTicket(t))
      .forEach(allocation -&gt; issuer.allocate(allocation));
  }
}</pre></div><p class="calibre7">If this code looks very strange to you, then you are probably not yet familiar with Lambda expressions. We have a <span class="strong"><strong class="calibre8">Context and Dependency Injection</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong class="calibre8">CDI</strong></span>) bean, which is application <a id="id10" class="calibre1"/>scoped, called <code class="email">CreditCardTicketTracker</code>. It has a method called <code class="email">processTickets()</code> that accepts a list collection of Ticket objects. The exact type of Ticket is unimportant. What is important, however, is the <code class="email">PaymentIssuer</code> type that the CDI injects into a <span class="strong"><strong class="calibre8">Plain Old Java Object</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong class="calibre8">POJO</strong></span>). The <a id="id11" class="calibre1"/>method <code class="email">processTickets()</code> invokes the stream API of the Java SE 8 collection. Essentially, invoking the method <code class="email">parallelStream()</code> causes processing on each element in the Java collection with multiple threads working in a concurrent operation. The Lambda expressions are on the <code class="email">filter()</code>, <code class="email">map()</code>, and the <code class="email">forEach()</code> methods of the updated Collection API.</p><p class="calibre7">Moreover, the code reads close enough to written English. Let me now explain the method <code class="email">processTickets()</code>. An outside component is sending batches of concert tickets for processing to our <a id="id12" class="calibre1"/>component <code class="email">CreditCardTicketTracker</code>. For each ticket in the batch, we filter only those tickets that are marked as available, which have already been paid for using a credit card, and where the concert date is two or more days after the current date. By the way, we take advantage of <code class="email">java.time.LocalDate</code>, which is new in Java SE 8.</p><p class="calibre7">So, very briefly, a Lambda expression is an anonymous method and the syntax follows this format:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">( [[Type1] param1 [,  [Type2] param2 ....]] ) -&gt; { 
  /*
   * Do something here and return a result type
   * including void
   */
}</pre></div><p class="calibre7">A lambda expression<a id="id13" class="calibre1"/> can be parameterless; therefore, the Java compiler can infer that an expression can be substituted for the <code class="email">java.lang.Runnable</code> type. If there are parameters, the compiler can infer the types of the arguments given enough information. Therefore, the Type1 and Type2 declarations are optional. A Lambda must return a single instance of a type or it may be void, which means the curly braces may be left off.</p><p class="calibre7">Lambda expressions are concise, timesaving, and allow functions to be passed to the libraries. For more information, consult the excellent Java Tutorial for Java SE 8 on Oracle's website (<a class="calibre1" href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/index.html">http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/index.html</a>). As we have<a id="id14" class="calibre1"/> seen in the previous example, your application could use the parallel stream facility in the collection to achieve concurrency.</p><p class="calibre7">One immediate use of the Lambda expressions is to replace the inner classes that call the managed thread services, <code class="email">javax.enterprise.concurrent.ManagedExecutorService</code> in Java EE 7. We know that Java has multiple-thread support, networking, and security. Let us turn our attention to the client side.</p></div>

Despite its many shortcomings, developers have learned to write modular applications that truly exploit the functionality of this programming language, which executes inside web browsers and servers universally. The framework that eventually changed the game was something called jQuery. It was then written by John Resig in order to simplify the client-side scripting of HTML in JavaScript. Released in 2006, it is the most popular framework in the JavaScript library<a id="id16" class="calibre1"/> today.</p><p class="calibre7">The greatest innovation in jQuery was the selector engine called Sizzle that allowed JavaScript programming to filter out the DOM elements by declarations, allow traversal, and perform algorithm through a type of collection comprehension. It introduced a new direction for JavaScript development.</p><p class="calibre7">It is not just jQuery that has been driving JavaScript. In truth, the progress can be tracked back to the re-discovery of AJAX techniques and the <a id="id17" class="calibre1"/>emergence of several competing frameworks <a id="id18" class="calibre1"/>such <span class="strong"><strong class="calibre8">Script.aculo.us</strong></span> and <span class="strong"><strong class="calibre8">Prototype</strong></span>.</p><p class="calibre7">The following is an <a id="id19" class="calibre1"/>example of a JavaScript code that uses jQuery:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">var xenonique = xenonique || {}

            }, 750);

      })
    }

    var oPublic = {

    };

    return oPublic;
}(jQuery);</pre></div><p class="calibre7">Please do not worry if you are struggling to understand the preceding code and certainly do not run away from this piece of JavaScript. The code shows the modern idiom of developing JavaScript in a good, reliable, and maintainable way without using global variables. It perfectly illustrates the module technique of keeping the JavaScript variables and function methods inside an enclosing scope. Scope is the most important item to understand in JavaScript programming.</p><p class="calibre7">The preceding <a id="id20" class="calibre1"/>JavaScript code creates a namespace called <span class="strong"><strong class="calibre8">xenonique</strong></span>, which<a id="id21" class="calibre1"/> exists in its own scope. We make use of the <code class="email">Module Pattern</code> to create a module called <code class="email">Main</code>, which depends on jQuery. There is a method defined called <code class="email">init()</code>, which executes a jQuery selector with an anonymous function. Whenever the user clicks on the HTML element with the ID <code class="email">#scrollToTheArrow</code>, the web page scrolls the top automatically in 750 milliseconds.</p><div class="book" title="The JavaScript module pattern"><div class="book"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h2 class="title1"><a id="ch01lvl2sec07" class="calibre1"/>The JavaScript module pattern</h2></div></div></div><p class="calibre7">The critical technique in this code, as elaborated by Douglas Crockford in his seminal book, <span class="strong"><em class="calibre9">JavaScript: The Good Parts</em></span>, is to create a module that acts like a singleton object. The module is invoked by the interpreter immediately because of the parameter argument statement at the end <a id="id22" class="calibre1"/>of the declaration, which relies on a jQuery<a id="id23" class="calibre1"/> instance.</p><p class="calibre7">Let's simplify the module for effect:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">var xenonique = xenonique || {}

xenonique.Main = function($) {
    /* ...a */
    return oPublic;
}(jQuery);</pre></div><p class="calibre7">The module <code class="email">xenonique.Main</code> in the preceding code is actually a JavaScript closure, which has its own scope. Thus, the module pattern simulates the private and public members and functions. The return value of the closure is an object that defines the publicly accessible properties and methods. In the module, the <code class="email">init()</code> method and the <code class="email">siteNavigationMarker</code> property are publicly accessible to other JavaScript variables. Closure is preserved in the return object with the JavaScript execution context and, therefore, all private and public methods will exist throughout the lifetime of the application.</p></div><div class="book" title="JavaScript advanced libraries"><div class="book"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h2 class="title1"><a id="ch01lvl2sec08" class="calibre1"/>JavaScript advanced libraries</h2></div></div></div><p class="calibre7">For some <a id="id24" class="calibre1"/>engineers, writing custom JavaScript, even around a<a id="id25" class="calibre1"/> jQuery selector, is too detailed and low-level.

An enterprise Java or server-side engineer<a id="id60" class="calibre1"/> has to be aware of other peoples' skill sets. (See the worker roles in <a class="calibre1" title="Appendix C. Agile Performance – Working inside Digital Teams" href="part0104.xhtml#aid-335QG1">Appendix C</a>, <span class="strong"><em class="calibre9">Agile Performance – Working inside Digital Teams</em></span>).</p></div></div>
<div class="book" title="Information architecture and user experience" id="aid-I3QM1"><div class="book"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h1 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl1sec12" class="calibre1"/>Information architecture and user experience</h1></div></div></div><p class="calibre7">The digital worker is confronted today by multiple inputs and customer design requirements. One<a id="id61" class="calibre1"/> of those is the so-called <span class="strong"><strong class="calibre8">Information Architecture</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong class="calibre8">IA</strong></span>).This is essentially about the static structure of a website, and describes the flow<a id="id62" class="calibre1"/> in order to obtain the best customer-user experience. Information architecture models the shared visual and contextual data that a customer can see in a web page, application, and environment.</p><p class="calibre7">Most Java engineers might have seen IA diagrams being passed around among the designers and business analysts during business team discussions. It would be an error to simply gloss over or ignore these discussions, which is why a digital developer ought to have some awareness about how, why, and where is the IA applied. It looks a bit like the visualization of a site map. The following is an example of an information architecture diagram for an e-commerce application:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="../Images/image00372.jpeg" alt="Information architecture and user experience" class="calibre10"/><div class="caption"><p class="calibre24">Basic information architecture for fashion store web site</p></div></div><p class="calibre11"> </p><p class="calibre7">The preceding <a id="id63" class="calibre1"/>diagram describes the IA for a potential fashion store<a id="id64" class="calibre1"/> web application. It might be considered too simplistic for this book. This diagram, however, is a work in progress for a pitch, a sales meeting in order to win the contract to develop and build the web application. Architecture is based on three components that are vital for the customer: the initial welcome page, the access to the catalogue and product, and content about the corporation. For this particular customer, the diagram reflects their concerns for the featured fashion items, brands, and promotions. The IA will evolve over time through further interactions with the customer. If we win the pitch to develop the fashion store application, potentially, it might be the searchability of the site that requires deeper investigation.</p><p class="calibre7">Information architecture helps the designers and developers along with the business stakeholder to understand the structure of the website through a shared language that consolidates the knowledge and purpose of the domain. A website owner and the business can view the IA as a breakdown of the content. They can comprehend how the site is built.</p><p class="calibre7">Information architecture <a id="id65" class="calibre1"/>can also be about kinesthetic reactions<a id="id66" class="calibre1"/> to the content (how someone feels inside). In the future, this would be important for wearable computers, because the user may not be looking at a screen for sensations and notifications. Interactions may be through sound or even through a smell or taste. These modeling techniques and an ability to write in a manner that has an emotional impact are embraced in a new and recent job title: the content strategist.</p><p class="calibre7">Writing and building a professional website or enterprise application has grown from its infancy. The developers now must be approachable, adaptable, and sophisticated. Approachable means the ability to work in harmony with others and as a team. Adaptable means being fearless in the face of constant challenges and changes; sophisticated means being able to cope with the stress and handling it gracefully.</p><p class="calibre7">Let's move on to understanding the technical aspect of the enterprise Java platform.</p></div>
<div class="book" title="Java EE 7 architecture" id="aid-J2B81"><div class="book"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h1 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl1sec13" class="calibre1"/>Java EE 7 architecture</h1></div></div></div><p class="calibre7">Java EE is an open standard, an enterprise platform, and a specification for applications that execute on a <a id="id67" class="calibre1"/>server. For the digital worker, Java EE provides many services for building web applications including Servlets, JavaServer Faces, Facelets, Context and Dependency Injection, Java Message Services, WebSocket, and crucial Java for RESTful services.</p><p class="calibre7">Java EE 7 was announced and released in June 2013, and the overreaching theme was better HTML5 support and increased productivity. Currently, it looks like the future Java EE 8 specification might add support for the administrative configuration of services and application aspects through declarative annotations (extension of JSR 220).</p><div class="book" title="Standard platform components and API"><div class="book"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h2 class="title1"><a id="ch01lvl2sec09" class="calibre1"/>Standard platform components and API</h2></div></div></div><p class="calibre7">Java EE<a id="id68" class="calibre1"/> architecture is a container and layer-based<a id="id69" class="calibre1"/> architecture. At the crux of the design is an application server and an increasingly cloud-based solution, although this is yet to be standardized in the specification.</p><p class="calibre7">In the non-cloud-based Java EE, we can think of Java EE as four separate containers: the first one is the EJB container for life cycle management of Enterprise Java Beans and the second container is the Web container for life cycle management of the Java Servlets and Managed Beans. The third container is called the Application Client container, which manages the lifecycle of the client-side components. Finally, the fourth container is reserved for <a id="id70" class="calibre1"/>Java Applets and their life cycles.</p><p class="calibre7">Most of the<a id="id71" class="calibre1"/> time, digital engineers are concerned about the EJB, web, and the managed CDI bean containers.</p><div class="informalexample" title="Note"><h3 class="title2"><a id="note03" class="calibre1"/>Note</h3><p class="calibre7">If you are interested in a full description of the architecture, please refer to my first book, <span class="strong"><em class="calibre9">The Java EE 7 Developer Handbook</em></span> by <span class="strong"><em class="calibre9">Packt Publishing</em></span>. You can consider it as a sister book to this one.</p></div><p class="calibre7">According to the Java EE 7 specification, there are two official implementation profiles: the full and the web profile. A fully conformant Java EE product such as Glassfish or JBoss WildFly application server implements the full profile, which means it has all containers: EJB, CDI, and web. A server like Apache Tomcat, which builds against the Java EE 7 web profile, implements only the web container. A server like Tom EE that extends the Apache Tomcat implements the web container, and may add extra facilities like CDI, EJB, and even JMS and JAX-RS.</p><p class="calibre7">The following diagram illustrates the full profile Java EE 7 architecture as an enterprise solution. The Java EE platform is an abstraction of the hardware, disk storage, networking, and the machine code. Java EE relies on the presence of a Java Virtual Machine for operation. There are versions of JVM that have been ported to hardware chips like Intel, ARM, AMD, Sparc, FreeScale, and others as well as to operating systems including Windows, Mac OS, Linux, Solaris, and even Raspberry Pi.</p><p class="calibre7">Therefore, Java and the other alternative languages can execute seamlessly on this chip architecture, and this applies to the enterprise applications. The Java EE provides additional standard API to the standard core Java SE. Let's take a brief look at some of the Java EE features.</p><p class="calibre7">Java EE 7 takes <a id="id72" class="calibre1"/>advantage of the <span class="strong"><strong class="calibre8">New Input Output</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong class="calibre8">NIO</strong></span>) feature in the Java SE edition to allow Java Servlets 3.1 to handle asynchronous communication.</p><p class="calibre7">JavaServer Faces 2.2 is now enhanced with tighter CDI integration, improved life cycle events, and a new queue control for AJAX requests. For the digital engineer, there is sensible HTML5 support, resource library contracts, faces flows, and stateless views.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="../Images/image00373.jpeg" alt="Standard platform components and API" class="calibre10"/><div class="caption"><p class="calibre24">An illustration of the Java EE 7 full platform and JSR specifications</p></div></div><p class="calibre11"> </p><p class="calibre7">Expression Language 3.0 is not truly a new specification, but it is a broken-out specification <a id="id73" class="calibre1"/>from Servlets, JavaServer Pages, and<a id="id74" class="calibre1"/> JavaServer Faces. Developers can access the expression evaluator and invoke processing on custom expressions like, say, their own custom tag libraries or server-side business logic.</p><p class="calibre7">Perhaps, the most important change in Java EE 7 is the strengthening of the CDI in order to improve type-safety and the easier development of CDI extensions. CDI, Interceptors, and Common Annotations improve the type-safe dependency injection and the observation of life cycle events inside the CDI container. These three specifications together ensure that extensions, which address crosscutting concerns and can be applied to any component, can be written. Developers can now write portable CDI extensions to extend the platform in a standard way.</p><p class="calibre7">RESTful Services (JAX-RS) has three crucial enhancements: the addition of client-side API to invoke a REST endpoint, asynchronous I/O support for the client and server endpoints, and hypermedia linking.</p><p class="calibre7">Bean validation is a constraint validation solution for domain and value object. It now supports method-level validation and also has better integration with the rest of the Java EE platform.</p><p class="calibre7">WebSocket API 1.0 is a new specification added to Java EE 7. It allows the Java application to communicate with the HTML5 WebSocket clients.</p><p class="calibre7">Java EE 7 continues the theme that was started in the earlier editions of the platform: improvements for ease-of-development and allowing the developers to write POJOs.</p></div></div>

          &lt;tr&gt;
            &lt;td&gt;Title:&lt;/td&gt;
            &lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;
             &amp;#160;#{taskListViewController.project.name}
            &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

        &lt;!-- form table grid see below --&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/ui:define&gt;
  &lt;/ui:composition&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;</pre></div><p class="calibre7">At first glance, this looks like standard HTML5; the specific JSF tags and the Expression Language syntax are not so obvious. The name of the file in the project is called <code class="email">projectTaskList.xhtml</code>, which serves a big clue to the type of view this file represents. This view is actually a JSF Facelet template. The file type refers to an older XHTML standard, as sanctioned by the <span class="strong"><strong class="calibre8">World Wide Web Consortium</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong class="calibre8">W3C</strong></span>) after the creation of<a id="id76" class="calibre1"/> the HTML 4.01 standard. XHTML is the same as HTML4, but restricted by an XML schema and, therefore, is genuinely an XML document.</p><p class="calibre7">In order to<a id="id77" class="calibre1"/> render any output from JSF, the specification stipulates the provision of a <span class="strong"><strong class="calibre8">Page Description Language</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong class="calibre8">PDL</strong></span>). It is possible to have more than one type of PDL. The standard PDL is a view called a Facelet view template. The Facelet framework was a separate open source API external to the JCP, but since <a id="id78" class="calibre1"/>JSF 2.0 it has been brought into the fold. Facelet templates are designed to be lightweight and work natively with the JSF framework. Facelets have implicit knowledge of the JSF lifecycle and have access to the UI components through expression language, and they provide decorators to standard HTML elements. The Facelets templating solution performs very well in servlet engines. It may eventually feature in its own specification for Java EE 8.</p><p class="calibre7">The templating in the preceding example is illustrated by the specific Facelet tags, namely <code class="email">&lt;ui:define&gt;</code> and <code class="email">&lt;ui:composition&gt;</code>. Briefly, the <code class="email">&lt;ui:composition&gt;</code> tag refers to a template view that defines the layout of the page. One can think of this as the master view. The <code class="email">&lt;ui:define&gt;</code> tag defines the actual content, which will be inserted into the template to form the final page output. We will comprehensively tackle JSF and Facelets in later chapters of this book.</p><p class="calibre7">By inspecting the opening XML definition at the top of the view definition, we can see a few namespace declarations. The <code class="email">xmlns:ui</code> namespace, as you have already seen, refers to the Facelet extensions. The <code class="email">xmlns:f</code> namespace refers to the core JSF tags and <code class="email">xmlns:h</code> namespace refers to the JSF components that render the HTML elements. You are warned not to expect a complete one-to-one match as you will understand later on. For instance, the <code class="email">&lt;h:outputText&gt;</code> tag simply prints out the content; you can almost think of it as the echo function in PHP.</p><p class="calibre7">The really observant among you will see that it is definitely possible to build modern websites with JSF. There is a <code class="email">&lt;div&gt;</code> element in the markup, and yes, as you may have guessed correctly, Bootstrap CSS is definitely being used. It is important to stress that JSF is a server-side templating solution and a view technology.</p><p class="calibre7">Look at the following section again:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">&lt;h:link styleClass="btn btn-primary" outcome="createTask.xhtml?id=#{taskListViewController.id}"&gt;</pre></div><p class="calibre7">This is approximately the equivalent to this straight HTML5:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">&lt;a style="btn btn-primary" href="JSF_munged_createTask.xhtml?id=jsf_fizz_12345"&gt;</pre></div><p class="calibre7">In JSF, the syntactic delimiters denote <code class="email">Expressions: #{...}</code>. The expression language is parsed in the JSF runtime during the rendering phase of the lifecycle. We will discuss the life cycle in the following chapters.</p><p class="calibre7">The previous<a id="id79" class="calibre1"/> view is incomplete, because we are missing the tabular view component. Although HTML tables are frowned upon due to the layout of content of the web pages, tables are still extremely important for their original purpose, that is, to display tabular data.</p><p class="calibre7">The following is the missing table view that should be inserted in the correct place:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">&lt;h:form&gt;
  &lt;h:dataTable id="projects" value="#{taskListViewController.project.tasks}" styleClass="table table-bordered" var="task"&gt;
    &lt;h:column&gt;
      &lt;f:facet name="header"&gt;
        &lt;h:outputText value="Task Name" /&gt;
        &lt;/f:facet&gt;
        &lt;h:outputText value="#{task.name}"/&gt;
    &lt;/h:column&gt;
    &lt;h:column&gt;
      &lt;f:facet name="header"&gt;
        &lt;h:outputText value="Target Date" /&gt;
      &lt;/f:facet&gt;
        &lt;h:outputText value="#{task.targetDate}"&gt;
          &lt;f:convertDateTime pattern="dd-MMM-yyyy" /&gt;
        &lt;/h:outputText&gt;
    &lt;/h:column&gt;
    &lt;h:column&gt;
      &lt;f:facet name="header"&gt;
        &lt;h:outputText value="Completed" /&gt;
      &lt;/f:facet&gt;
      &lt;h:outputText value="#{task.completed}"/&gt;
    &lt;/h:column&gt;
    &lt;h:column&gt;
      &lt;f:facet name="header"&gt;
        &lt;h:outputText value="Action" /&gt;
      &lt;/f:facet&gt;
      &lt;h:link styleClass="btn" outcome="editTask.xhtml?taskId=#{task.id}"&gt;
        &lt;f:param name="taskId" value="#{task.id}" /&gt;
        &lt;i class="icon-edit"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;
      &lt;/h:link&gt;
      &lt;h:link styleClass="btn" outcome="removeTask.xhtml?taskId=#{task.id}"&gt;
        &lt;f:param name="taskId" value="#{task.id}" /&gt;
          &lt;i class="icon-trash"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;
      &lt;/h:link&gt;

    &lt;/h:column&gt;
  &lt;/h:dataTable&gt;
  &lt;hr/&gt;
  &lt;h:commandLink styleClass="btn btn-primary btn-info" immediate="true" action="#{taskListViewController.returnToProjects}"&gt;
    Return to Projects&lt;/h:commandLink&gt;
&lt;/h:form&gt;</pre></div><p class="calibre7">The <a id="id80" class="calibre1"/>preceding code exemplifies the JSF style of content. The <code class="email">&lt;h:form&gt;</code> tag corresponds to a HTML Form element. The <code class="email">&lt;h:dataTable&gt;</code> tag denotes the table component grid that renders the data from the managed JSF bean. The value attribute denotes the data that is retrieved from a server component named <code class="email">taskListViewController</code>. This controller accesses the list collection of Task objects using the expression language, and translates it to the Java reflection invocation of <code class="email">taskListViewController.getProjects().getTasks()</code>. It is worth noticing once more the Bootstrap CSS in the attribute <code class="email">styleClass="table table-bordered"</code>.</p><p class="calibre7">The <code class="email">&lt;h:dataTable&gt;</code> JSF component essentially iterates over a Java Collection, array, iterator, or enumerator, sets the current element defined by the attribute <code class="email">var</code>, and processes the content in its body. It builds an HTML table. The <code class="email">&lt;h:column&gt;</code> tag declares the content in each column of the row and <code class="email">&lt;f:facet&gt;</code> tag declares the content specifically to go into the table header rows.</p><p class="calibre7">The <code class="email">&lt;h:outputText&gt;</code> tag is also flexible enough to accept another usual tag <code class="email">&lt;f:convertDateTime&gt;</code>, which formats the particular data value into a date time format.</p><p class="calibre7">Finally, we have the <code class="email">h:commandLink</code> tag that renders an HTML anchor tag, which behaves like a form submit button. The <code class="email">h:commandLink</code> tag is optionally associated with a backing bean, which in our case is the <code class="email">taskListViewController</code>. Certain components of the JSF HTML tags like <code class="email">h:dataTable</code> and <code class="email">h:commandLink</code> are contained in an <code class="email">h:form</code> tag in order to be processed correctly.</p><div class="informalexample" title="Note"><h3 class="title2"><a id="tip05" class="calibre1"/>Tip</h3><p class="calibre7">Bootstrap<a id="id81" class="calibre1"/> CSS (<a class="calibre1" href="http://getbootstrap.com">http://getbootstrap.com</a>) is a very <a id="id82" class="calibre1"/>popular CSS, component, and front-end framework for developing responsive websites.

The basic principle of Java: write once run-everywhere, ought be achievable. The fly in the ointment is when the code relies on vendor-specific features that are not part of the standard. It is also worth pointing out that TCK is not free. In fact, I know a very good source of information, who mentioned the cost to be at least $250 K. Therefore, this barrier to <a id="id89" class="calibre1"/>entry is beyond the remit of the majority of open source projects or <span class="strong"><strong class="calibre8">Small &amp; Medium Enterprises</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong class="calibre8">SME</strong></span>), without significant investment from angels or kick-starter funds.</p><p class="calibre7">At the beginning of 2014, Oracle announced that it would be removing the commercial support for the GlassFish server. This news had the Java EE community up-in-arms about the future of the application server. Oracle clarified later that there was a roadmap for GlassFish 5, and it was still on the agenda to be the reference implementation for Java EE 8. The database vendor and Java steward instead recommended the avenue of upgrading to Oracle WebLogic for production. In 2014, Oracle released WebLogic 12.1.3 with selected Java EE 7 compliant components.</p><p class="calibre7">WildFly 9 (<a class="calibre1" href="http://wildfly.org/">http://wildfly.org/</a>) is the <a id="id90" class="calibre1"/>next generation of application servers from Red Hat. The <a id="id91" class="calibre1"/>server features a modular architecture based on a new class loader infrastructure in an attempt to avoid the issue of conflicting dependencies between the third party JARs and the infrastructure within the server itself. There are two key benefits to WildFly: the new high performance HTTP server, which is called <a id="id92" class="calibre1"/>Undertow (<a class="calibre1" href="http://undertow.io/">http://undertow.io/</a>) and the reduction of <a id="id93" class="calibre1"/>administration ports. The ports are 8080 for web traffic, Servlets, REST, and WebSocket endpoint and 9990 for server administration. With WildFly it is possible to invoke the EJB remote methods through the de facto HTTP port 8080, which adds some interesting possibilities for enterprise applications.</p><p class="calibre7">The modular approach in WildFly 9 appears to be suitable for end sites that prefer to have a strict control over the deployment of their enterprise architecture. WildFly has a download option called the <span class="strong"><em class="calibre9">core</em></span> distribution, which allows developers to configure the modules that they require in an application server runtime. The final benefit of WildFly is that it is the first Java EE 7 server that is compatible with Java SE 8 (Lambdas and default interfaces). Only GlassFish 4.1 releases are compatible with Java SE 8.</p><p class="calibre7">After the debacle of the professional support for GlassFish, another corporation entered the space. C2B2 Consulting <a id="id94" class="calibre1"/>offered an open source adaptation of GlassFish <a id="id95" class="calibre1"/>called Payara Server (<a class="calibre1" href="http://payara.co.uk">http://payara.co.uk</a>) with 24/7 production support.</p><p class="calibre7">I should quickly mention one other server that is gaining track with the server-side Java community and that is worth keeping an eye on in the near future. The Apache Software Foundation has an open source<a id="id96" class="calibre1"/> project called Tom EE (<a class="calibre1" href="http://tomee.apache.org/">http://tomee.apache.org/</a>). Tom EE (pronounced <span class="strong"><em class="calibre9">Tommy</em></span>) is, essentially, Apache Tomcat 7 with additional extensions, which are already configured, to support JSF, JPA JAX-RS, CDI, and EJB. David Blevins, a popular speaker and an ASF committer, was the founder of the Tom EE project. At the<a id="id97" class="calibre1"/> time of writing, Tom EE is only certified against Java EE 6 Web Profile; however, there are plans to add support to Java EE 7. Business stakeholders can obtain commercial and production support for Tom EE through vendors like<a id="id98" class="calibre1"/> Tomi Tribe (<a class="calibre1" href="http://www.tomitribe.com/">http://www.tomitribe.com/</a>).</p><p class="calibre7">Since GlassFish, WildFly, and Payara are the only application servers certified as Java EE 7-compliant at <a id="id99" class="calibre1"/>the time of writing, we will concentrate only on them for the rest of this book. The source code examples work with both these servers. Wherever necessary, we will point out the differences and explain the features appropriately. Let us now continue our journey into the digital web with Java EE 7.</p></div>
<div class="book" title="Summary" id="aid-LTSU1"><div class="book"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h1 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl1sec16" class="calibre1"/>Summary</h1></div></div></div><p class="calibre7">In this chapter, we discussed the role of the digital worker, that is, you, the engineer and how you fit into the new marketing role as a creative person. We looked at the skills and the tool chain set that is certainly expected in the years 2015 and 2016. We covered how the Java platform and JVM fit into this picture.</p><p class="calibre7">Being a Digital Java EE 7 worker is more than just developing the server-side Java code; you are expected to understand JavaScript programming at an elementary level. Some of you may already have basic JavaScript knowledge and some others will understand a lot more about programming in the client space. JavaScript, for all its warts and mishaps, is a professional language that deserves respect, and we covered some of the frameworks that you are expected to know. Whilst this book does not teach you JavaScript and is aimed at Java EE development, I recommend that you brush up on your skills apropos module patterns and applying advanced libraries.</p><p class="calibre7">In this chapter, we looked at the Java EE 7 architecture and the specifications that are part of the platform. Finally, we pored over the code of a simple JavaServer Faces example. In particular, we inspected a Facelet view code. We noticed that much of the view resembles standard HTML.</p><p class="calibre7">In the upcoming chapters, we will delve deeply into the JSF and build a simple <span class="strong"><strong class="calibre8">Create Retrieve Update Delete</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong class="calibre8">CRUD</strong></span>) example. We will be generating the example in a couple of different ways. As the saying goes, we have to crawl before we can walk, and walk before we can run. Our crawling is over, now let's starting walking.</p></div>

On a scale of 1-10 (1 being novice and 10 expert) ask yourself how much do you honestly know?</li><li class="listitem">When was the last time you looked at Java EE? If you still think of enterprise development as the term J2EE, then you definitely need to take a look at the book, <span class="strong"><em class="calibre9">Java EE Developer Handbook</em></span>. Make a note of the specifications that you do not know quite so well and plan to learn them.</li><li class="listitem">Test your understanding of the Java EE platform by matching the parts of the specification to a recent web application that you have been involved in. Describe how each specification can provide benefits, including productivity gains.</li><li class="listitem">Now switch to the other side and dissent against Java EE. Some voices in the community are for and some are decidedly against standardization. The detractors say that the standardization process is too slow for a world of need and innovation. What do you think are the potential pitfalls of relying on the Java EE platform? Think of areas beyond software development, such as education, training, hiring, and the wider community. What would be the ideal state of Java where you can do what you like and without responsibility?</li><li class="listitem">You probably already have a favorite website, which you visit regularly, perhaps everyday. Draw or outline the basic (high level) information architecture for it. Chances are that your favorite website has a lot of rich content and has been around for a long time. What changes have you noticed with the information architecture that you know today?</li><li class="listitem">How good is your JavaScript knowledge? On a scale of 1 (beginner) and 10 (expert), how do you rate it as a skill? How does your JavaScript compare against your Java programming?</li><li class="listitem"> Did you know that you can examine HTML, CSS, and JavaScript dynamically from a modern web browser with Developer Tools (Chrome Developer Tools <a class="calibre1" href="https://developer.chrome.com/devtools">https://developer.chrome.com/devtools</a> or Christopher Pederick's Web Developer Tools <a class="calibre1" href="http://chrispederick.com/work/web-developer/">http://chrispederick.com/work/web-developer/</a> or similar)? Have you ever learnt to debug JavaScript through these tools? Why not learn to simply add a break point to the code? How about using the inspector to examine the computed CSS?</li><li class="listitem">Using the distributed version control system, Git, to clone the book source code from GitHub (<a class="calibre1" href="http://github.com/peterpilgrim/digitaljavaee7">http://github.com/peterpilgrim/digitaljavaee7</a>), and examine the code around the simple JSF example given in this chapter. Download and setup the GlassFish 4.1 (<a class="calibre1" href="https://glassfish.java.net/">https://glassfish.java.net/</a>) or WildFly 9 (<a class="calibre1" href="http://wildfly.org/">http://wildfly.org/</a>) application servers and get the first examples running.</li><li class="listitem">How good are your image-editing skills in web design (using a commercial application Adobe Photoshop or Firework or Xara Edit)? Do you partake in this activity at work or at home, or do you delegate this effort to another person, like a creative designer? Would it benefit your wider career plans to have better knowledge in this area? Ask yourself, would it make you be a better digital worker?</li><li class="listitem">The digital teams practicing Agile software development tend to work with the stakeholders. It they are lucky, they are in direct contact with the stakeholder. The stakeholder is the customer, a representative of the business end users, to which these teams are delivering software. Have you ever had conversations directly with the stakeholder(s)? What was the outcome of these discussions? How did they go? Did you ever wish to be more involved? Did you ever feel like running away? How could your efforts in these talks have been better, retrospectively? Put yourself in your stakeholder's shoes to understand how he perceives you.</li></ol><div class="calibre25"/></div></div></body></html>
