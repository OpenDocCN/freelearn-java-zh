There is an incredible amount of things to learn and to explore. Almost anyone can find something in it as per their interest, starting from HTTP, Web, software dependency problems, and ending with hardware-specific JIT optimization techniques, and concurrency challenges. Such variety is very unique and it would be true to say that there is no other open source project that can provide something similar. The other factor is that there are not so many other open source projects on that scale; possibly only the Linux core. Such scale requires a non-trivial organizational approach and, to be involved in that process, to see how it works, is a very interesting insight.</p><p>This cookbook will lead you through steps to take you into the world of OpenJDK as smoothly as possible. It starts by explaining how to download the source code and how to build the different versions of OpenJDK, how to set it up on a machine, and what different options are available. Then, you will learn how to set up the development environment (IDE) required for editing and debugging C++ and Java source code, and how to start making changes. It will go through some examples, which you may decide to change in various parts of OpenJDK. Further, it will cover the tools available for testing, benchmarking, and ensuring that the changes you have made are not breaking the existing functionality. As OpenJDK is a big project with its own rules and processes, there will be a part covering the procedures that are involved in making changes or fixing bugs, the lifecycle of projects, JSRs, JEPs, and so on. At the end, there will be a section about future work that is planned to be included in forthcoming releases; that part will be the most interesting section for anyone who is interested in the future direction of OpenJDK and wants to try something new, which is not yet available in the stable product.</p><p>In addition, this book contains many practical examples which should be useful to any developer who is working with OpenJDK or any other Java technology. They are available in simple form, which allows you to quickly copy and use them for your own project.</p><div class="section" title="What this book covers"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl1sec02"/>What this book covers</h1></div></div></div><p><a class="link" href="ch01.html" title="Chapter 1. Getting Started with OpenJDK">Chapter 1</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Getting Started with OpenJDK</em></span>, provides an overview of OpenJDK, explains what it is, and covers the basic steps required to have OpenJDK running and properly configured on the machine.</p><p><a class="link" href="ch02.html" title="Chapter 2. Building OpenJDK 6">Chapter 2</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Building OpenJDK 6</em></span>, covers the steps required to build OpenJDK Version 6. This build is very different from OpenJDK 7 and OpenJDK 8 and requires more manual work to be done.</p><p><a class="link" href="ch03.html" title="Chapter 3. Building OpenJDK 7">Chapter 3</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Building OpenJDK 7</em></span>, covers the steps required to build OpenJDK Version 7. Building OpenJDK 7 is an easier and more enjoyable process, compared to OpenJDK 6.</p><p><a class="link" href="ch04.html" title="Chapter 4. Building OpenJDK 8">Chapter 4</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Building OpenJDK 8</em></span>, covers the steps required to build OpenJDK Version 8.</p><p><a class="link" href="ch05.html" title="Chapter 5. Building IcedTea">Chapter 5</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Building IcedTea</em></span>, teaches you how to build a set of tools that are developed apart from OpenJDK. These tools are replaced with some proprietary bits that are not available as open source, which include a browser plugin, Java WebStart, and so on.</p><p><a class="link" href="ch06.html" title="Chapter 6. Building IcedTea with Other VM Implementations">Chapter 6</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Building IcedTea with Other VM Implementations</em></span>, covers some interesting VM projects, which also can benefit from the features provided by IcedTea, and how to build that product using these VMs and non-x86 CPUs.</p><p><a class="link" href="ch07.html" title="Chapter 7. Working with WebStart and the Browser Plugin">Chapter 7</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Working with WebStart and the Browser Plugin</em></span>, will cover the configuration and installation of WebStart and browser plugin components, which are the biggest parts of the IcedTea project.</p><p><a class="link" href="ch08.html" title="Chapter 8. Hacking OpenJDK">Chapter 8</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Hacking OpenJDK</em></span>, covers some bits which are required to start digging into the OpenJDK source code. Such things are the installation and setup of IDE, debugging, and updating HotSpot source code. There are also some useful examples of what the developer can do, for example, implementing your own intrinsic details.</p><p><a class="link" href="ch09.html" title="Chapter 9. Testing OpenJDK">Chapter 9</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Testing OpenJDK</em></span>, will go through an approach used in OpenJDK to test the source code and, since writing code is not enough, we need to write high quality product on which the code has to be tested. This chapter will also show you some examples to use the latest available tools.</p><p><a class="link" href="ch10.html" title="Chapter 10. Contributing to OpenJDK">Chapter 10</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Contributing to OpenJDK</em></span>, explains how OpenJDK is changing and evolving, how changes are executed, and what one needs to do to participate or to facilitate changes in OpenJDK. Some of these changes, if they are big enough, can take years to appear in the production version.</p><p><a class="link" href="ch11.html" title="Chapter 11. Troubleshooting">Chapter 11</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Troubleshooting</em></span>, teaches you about one of the most important parts of any project: bug fixing. It is important to understand which tools and processes are involved. In this chapter, we will cover some important steps, from submitting defects, to pushing the fix into the shared repository.</p><p><a class="link" href="ch12.html" title="Chapter 12. Working with Future Technologies">Chapter 12</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Working with Future Technologies</em></span>, covers some future developments in OpenJDK. As with any big project, OpenJDK has a roadmap with some exciting and promising projects for the next releases. That is exactly what this chapter is about. It lists all the steps required to download sources, build, and run some examples, where possible.</p><p><a class="link" href="ch13.html" title="Chapter 13. Build Automation">Chapter 13</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Build Automation</em></span>, provides some useful tips for automating the build process. It will be useful for those developers who make frequent changes in OpenJDK or always want to have the build with all the latest changes.</p></div></div>
