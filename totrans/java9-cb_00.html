<p class="mce-root">This cookbook offers a range of software development examples in simple and straightforward Java 9 code, providing step-by-step resources and time-saving methods to help you solve data problems efficiently. Starting with the installation of Java, each recipe addresses a specific problem, with a discussion that explains the solution, and offers insight into how it works. We cover major concepts about the core programming language as well as common tasks to build a wide variety of software. You will learn new features in the form of recipes, to make your application modular, secure, and fast.</p>

Here are some examples of these styles and an explanation of their meaning. Code words in text, database table names, folder names, filenames, file extensions, pathnames, dummy URLs, user input, and Twitter handles are shown as follows: "When run, it produces the same value as with an object of the <kbd>Vehicle</kbd> class."
