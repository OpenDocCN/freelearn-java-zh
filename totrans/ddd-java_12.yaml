- en: In the previous section, we built an application from scratch. However, we packaged
    all components in a single deployable as a monolith. In this part, we will extend
    the application we built in *Part 2* by exploring various options on how we can
    decompose this application iteratively into finer-grained components. We will
    also look at the implications of decomposition along both functional and cross-functional
    aspects.
