    easier in Spring Boot. Improving productivity with Spring Boot involves simplifying
    configuration, reducing boilerplate code, and utilizing integrations and tools
    that facilitate faster development cycles, better code quality, and smoother deployment
    processes. We’ll kick things off by diving into **aspect-oriented programming**
    (**AOP**) within Spring Boot, understanding how it helps create a more organized
    code base by separating cross-cutting concerns from our main application logic.
    This approach makes our code easier to maintain and comprehend.

    a programming approach that helps separate concerns in your application, especially
    the ones that cut across multiple parts of your app, such as logging, transaction
    management, or security. Think about the logging; you can add a logger line in
    every method. AOP helps you keep them separate, so your main code stays clean
    and focused on what it’s supposed to do. It again logs the required data as a
    part of a separate class.'

    these cross-cutting concerns without turning your code into spaghetti. With AOP,
    you can define advice (which means AOP speaks for the code that should run at
    a certain point), pointcuts (where in your code you want that advice to run),
    and aspects (the combination of advice and pointcuts). This means you can automatically
    apply common functionality across your application in a consistent way, all without
    messing with the core logic of your services. In the next section, we will see
    these in more detail.

    this interface, you can tell Feign where to send the request, what to send, and
    how to handle the response. This frees you up to focus on your application’s needs

    specific conditions. For instance, you may want a bean to load only when a certain
    property is set or when a particular class is present. Spring Boot offers various
    `@Conditional` annotations to cater to different scenarios, including `@ConditionalOnProperty`,
    `@ConditionalOnClass`, and `@ConditionalOnExpression`.

    `logging.aspect.enabled` property value. This condition creates the `LoggingAspect`
    bean based on the property’s value. If our value is `true`, then our `loggingAspect`
    class will work and log the methods. If the value is `false`, then this class
    will not be initiated and there will be no log in our console output.
