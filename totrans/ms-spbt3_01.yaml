    isn’t a manual; instead, it serves as your roadmap to navigate the complex world
    of modern Java development. Spring Boot is not a newcomer but a mature framework
    that has been simplifying Java development for years. But in the 3.0 release,
    Spring Boot has made the development process even more seamless and more convenient
    to use. Java 17 is the minimum version of Java required with Spring Boot 3.0,
    and Java 19 is also among the versions supported, which ensures that developers
    will be able to utilize the latest features or improvements of Java. Spring Boot
    3.0 presents AppStartup – a feature to register callbacks in different stages
    of application startup, aiding with tasks such as resource initialization and
    configuration error checking. In addition to that, there is a new algorithm in
    Spring Boot 3.0 for dependency resolution to help increase the start speed and
    lower the memory footprint, so more complex projects are handled more efficiently.

    we are speaking of cloud-native, in reality, we are referring to applications
    that are designed for cloud environments such as AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud.
    Spring Boot has got great features such as scalability and elasticity for applications
    in such environments, which means our application will grow or shrink horizontally
    as per demand, plus we get access to multiple managed services.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Want to build your application using Spring Boot and deploy it on the cloud?
    The good news is that Spring Boot encapsulates all the configuration details,
    hence making the deployment process on the cloud very simple. It has been designed
    to work smoothly with cloud environments. This means you can easily bind your
    application to the various cloud services that providers offer. Such services
    could span databases and storage solutions all the way to identity management
    systems.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One of the advantages that comes with using Spring Boot for cloud-native applications
    is adaptability. Whether you go with the public cloud, private cloud, or some
    mix of both – which we call hybrid environments – Spring Boot provides a simplified
    experience. There are never concerns about complexities associated with the manual
    configurations of this. The cloud-native capabilities within Spring Boot put you
    in a position to make optimal use of the abilities available today across cloud
    computing.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This means adjusting the application’s scaling up or down based on some ongoing
    situation at a particular point in time. For example, you want to create an application
    that will automatically scale its resources upon the sudden increase of its users
    – this will involve cloud-native development in Spring Boot and deployment in
    the Cloud Foundry. In this situation, Spring Boot is the bridge because it takes
    care of your application and ensures it stays functional with full utilization
    of what has been provided in the cloud environment. It will make your development
    process effective and efficient and ensure you develop applications that are more
    resilient to deploy.

    Spring Boot aids with this massive process. As you will know, it is very important
    to test sufficiently in order to ensure that our software is reliable and behaving
    as expected. I’m sure you will be well familiar with the reasons why testing is
    so important – we have to catch bugs and issues before our software goes live.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Spring Boot really promotes testing and has a lot of tools and conventions to
    make this possible. That ensures not only saving time in the long run but also
    a better product for our users. Spring Boot perfectly suits this approach, being
    all about “testing first.” This approach drives us to consider testing with every
    step of development, and not as an afterthought.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now then, how does Spring Boot help us test? One nice thing about it is that
    it’s flexible, so it doesn’t introduce various testing frameworks, which would
    create compatibility issues. Whether you prefer JUnit, TestNG, or any other popular
    testing tools, with Spring Boot, any of these tools can be easily integrated into
    the workflow. This way, you can decide on the tools you would be comfortable with
    using and Spring Boot will not restrict your choice.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Moreover, Spring Boot doesn’t limit you to just one type of testing. It lets
    you write different kinds of tests – from unit tests that verify the correctness
    of a small piece of code to integration tests that verify that different parts
    of your application communicate well among themselves, and even end-to-end tests
    that simulate how a user will journey through your application. The idea here
    is to equip you with all those tools and flexibility, in order to test your application
    at any level in depth.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In a nutshell, Spring Boot equips you with everything that makes your testing
    efficient and effective. It’s like having a toolkit where each tool is made to
    address a specific testing need, making your software robust and reliable. Remember
    that good testing is one of the key elements of quality software development,
    and Spring Boot stands to guide you through it.

    Sourcing
  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This chapter deep dives into critical patterns for microservices. In a microservice
    system, you might have many microservices, depending on the size of the application;
    for example, Netflix has over 1,000 microservices. So, what we need is an excellent
    pattern to manage these microservices and then maintain them properly. Without
    it, we lose control of them, and the whole system becomes a huge garbage.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The first one is **Domain-Driven Design** (**DDD**). DDD is about building software
    based on the needs of the business. Each microservice is solely accountable for
    only one small part of a business. In DDD, we have two main parts, which are the
    strategic part and the tactical part. In the strategic part, we take a look at
    the big picture of a business. The details that we focus on are the tactical part.
    Here, we’ll take a detailed look at everything there is to know about each part
    of the business.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Next is **CQRS**. It is the abbreviated form of **Command Query Responsibility
    Segregation**. I love the name. It’s such a fancy name for a simple idea. We separate
    reading the data from writing the data. Think about it as two tools – one kind
    asks questions and another gives orders. This separation allows our software to
    run smoother and faster. It’s great for complicated systems where it is really
    important to manage lots of data.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Next, we have Event Sourcing. This is recording all changes that are made to
    our software as events. Anytime there occurs a change in the transacting parties,
    we note this down in the diary. As such, the diary logs what happened in the past.
    We can dig deep into the history of our object as well. Event Sourcing is relevant
    as there could at any time be the need to hold past data.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Lastly, we take a quick view of other patterns in microservices. This part merely
    suggests some other ideas for building software. We will not go into too much
    detail here but it’s good to know about these other patterns. They are like different
    tools in a toolbox. Knowing more tools makes us better at building software.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    see how they are leveraged in real software. This helps us understand better why
    these patterns are important and how to use them soundly.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    how to use DDD, CQRS, and Event Sourcing. These will help us write software that
    is strong, smart, and useful and solve real business problems. The chapter is
    all about learning these essential skills.

    of reactive programming in Spring Boot 3.0\. Here, we learn how to build software
    that responds quickly. This is about making applications that can handle multiple
    concurrent or simultaneous requests.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We start with an introduction to reactive programming. It’s a fresh way of writing
    software. In the old days, our apps could only do one thing at a time. With reactive
    programming, they can handle many tasks all at once, smoothly and without waiting.
    It’s like a juggler keeping many balls in the air effortlessly.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'Building a reactive REST API is our next stop. Think of REST APIs as waiters
    taking orders and bringing food to the table: one waiter, one order. A reactive
    REST API is like a super-waiter who can handle many orders simultaneously, even
    when the restaurant is super busy. It’s great for when you have lots of users,
    all wanting quick service at the same time.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We then explore asynchronous systems and backpressure. Asynchronous means doing
    things at different times, not in a strict order. It’s like having a to-do list
    where you can do tasks in any order you like. Back-pressure is a way to manage
    the work, so we don’t get overwhelmed. It’s like having a smart system that knows
    when to say, “Please wait” so that everything gets done right, without crashing
    or slowing down.

    just talked about these ideas; we’ll have seen them in action with real examples.
    We’ll understand why reactive programming is essential in today’s fast-paced world.
    We’ll learn how to use these new tools to make our software strong, smart, and
    helpful. And we’ll see how they solve real problems in businesses today. This
    chapter is packed with essential skills for the modern software builder.

    within Spring Boot 3.0 applications. It’s a chapter that combines theory with
    practical steps on handling various types of data.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We kick off with an introduction to Spring Data. This is one of the most important
    components of Spring Boot. We can orchestrate the data with it. Spring Data is
    like a bridge connecting your application to the world of databases. We’ll see
    how Spring Data can talk to databases hassle-free.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Then, we’ll explore how Spring Data connects with SQL databases. SQL databases
    store data in tables and are great when you have a clear structure for your data.
    They’re reliable and powerful. With Spring Boot, using these databases becomes
    easier. You can set up relationships and store your data efficiently.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Next, we shift our focus to NoSQL databases. These are different from SQL databases.
    They’re more like a flexible storage room where you can put data without needing
    a strict layout. Spring Boot supports various NoSQL databases, such as MongoDB,
    Neo4j, and Cassandra. These databases are great when your data doesn’t fit neatly
    into tables and you need more flexibility.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We’ll also discuss Spring Boot’s cache abstraction. Caching is about storing
    copies of data in a temporary storage area, so you can access it faster. It’s
    like keeping your most-used tools on top of your workbench for quick access. Spring’s
    cache abstraction lets you manage this caching smartly, improving your application’s
    performance by remembering frequently used data.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Then, there’s batch processing with Spring Batch. This is for when you have
    a lot of data to process all at once. Think of it like a factory assembly line,
    handling lots of tasks efficiently. Spring Batch is a framework for developing
    robust batch applications. It’s used for large-scale data migration and processing,
    making it perfect for handling big jobs such as sending out thousands of emails
    or processing large datasets.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    one place to another, you want to ensure nothing gets lost or changed along the
    way. We’ll learn strategies to keep our data safe and consistent during migration.
    It’s like moving houses without losing any of your belongings.

    really getting our hands dirty with testing in Spring Boot. Testing isn’t just
    a checkbox to tick off; it’s what makes sure our applications don’t fall apart
    when things get real. And in Spring Boot, testing can be quite a ride!

    of Spring Boot. TDD is like writing the recipe before you bake the cake. It might
    sound backward, but it’s a game-changer. We write tests first, then code, and
    end up with something that’s not just delicious but dependable.
