- en: Dependency Injection is a design pattern that allows us to remove the hardcoded
    dependencies and make our application loosely coupled, extendable, and maintainable.
    We can implement dependency injection to move the dependency resolution from compile-time
    to runtime.

    Injection?*, gives you a detailed insight into various concepts, such as Dependency
    Inversion of Principle (DIP), Inversion of Control (IoC), and Dependency Injection
    (DI). It also talks about practical use cases where DI is commonly used.'
