- en: The last decade has constantly changed how we think and write applications including
    the persistence layer, which must face new challenges such as working in microservice
    architectures and cloud environments. Flexibility, versatility, dialect agnostic,
    rock-solid SQL support, small learning curve, and high performance are just a
    few of the attributes that makes jOOQ the most appealing persistence technology
    for modern applications.

- en: Being part of the modern technology stack, jOOQ is the new persistence trend
    that respects all standards of a mature, robust, and well-documented technology.
    This book covers jOOQ in detail, so it prepares you to become a jOOQ power-user
    and an upgraded version of yourself ready to handle the future of the persistence
    layer. Don't think of jOOQ as just another piece of technology; think of it as
    part of your mindset, your straightforward road to exploiting SQL instead of abstracting
    it, and your approach to doing things right in your organization.

    Boot*, shows how to create a kickoff application that involves jOOQ and Spring
    Boot in Java/Kotlin under Maven/Gradle.'

- en: '[*Chapter 2*](B16833_02.xhtml#_idTextAnchor024), *Customizing the jOOQ Level
    of Involvement*, covers the configurations (declarative and programmatic) needed
    for employing jOOQ as a type-safe query builder and executor. Moreover, we set
    up jOOQ to generate POJOs and DAOs on our behalf. We use Java/Kotlin under Maven/Gradle.'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '*Chapter 3*, *jOOQ Core Concepts*, discusses jOOQ core concepts such as fluent
    API, SQL syntax correctness, emulating missing syntax/logic, jOOQ result set,
    jOOQ records, type safety, CRUD binding, and inlining parameters.'

- en: '[*Chapter 4*](B16833_04.xhtml#_idTextAnchor069), *Building a DAO Layer (Evolving
    the Generated DAO Layer)*, shows how implementing a DAO layer can be done in several
    ways/templates. We tackle an approach for evolving the DAO layer generated by
    jOOQ.'
