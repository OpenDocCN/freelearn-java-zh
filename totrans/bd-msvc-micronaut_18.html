			<p>The answers for chapters 1 to 9 are mostly theoretical or practical. So it is enough to have read through them to answer the questions in those chapters.</p>

				<li><strong class="bold">Internet of Things</strong> (<strong class="bold">IoT</strong>) is a network of devices or things. These things could be anything from a human wearing a health monitor, a pet wearing a geolocation sensor, a car with a tire pressure sensor, a television with voice/visual capabilities, or a smart speaker.<p>We discussed this in the <em class="italic">Basics of IoT</em> section.</p></li>
				<li>Doorbells, locks, lightbulbs, speakers, televisions, healthcare systems, fitness systems, Google Home, Amazon Alexa, Apple Siri, Microsoft Cortana, and Samsung Bixby.<p>We discussed this in the <em class="italic">Basics of IoT</em> section.</p></li>
				<li>Alexa skills are like apps, and you can enable or disable skills using the Alexa app for a specific device. Skills are voice-based Alexa capabilities. <p>We discussed this in the <em class="italic">Basics of IoT</em> section.</p></li>
				<li>Intents capture events the end user wants to implement with their voice. An intent represents an action that is triggered by the user's spoken request. Intents in Alexa are specified in a JSON structure called intent schema. Built-in intents are <strong class="bold">Cancel</strong>, <strong class="bold">Help</strong>, <strong class="bold">Stop</strong>, <strong class="bold">Navigate Home</strong>, and <strong class="bold">Fallback</strong>. Some intents are basic, such as Help, and the skills should have a <strong class="bold">Help</strong> intent.<p>We discussed this in the <em class="italic">Basics of intents</em> section.</p></li>
				<li>Java, Node.js, C#, or Go.</li>
				<li>We discussed this in the <em class="italic">Your first HelloWorld Alexa skill</em> section.</li>
				<li><strong class="source-inline">LaunchRequestHandler</strong>. <strong class="source-inline">LaunchRequestHandler</strong> is the first intent code that is triggered whenever a skill is launched.<p>We discussed this in the <em class="italic">Your first HelloWorld Alexa skill</em> section.</p></li>
				<li><strong class="source-inline">@Singleton</strong> annotation. To change any Alexa Java handler to work with Micronaut, all we need to do is to add the <strong class="source-inline">@Singleton</strong> annotation, which is the <strong class="source-inline">javax.inject.Singleton</strong> annotation.</li>
				<li>We discussed this in the <em class="italic">Integrating Micronaut with Alexa</em> section.</li>

				<li value="1">The following are a few factors to consider when architecting microservices are the following:<ul><li>Does your team know about microservices? </li><li>Is your business mature enough to adopt microservices? </li><li>Do you have an Agile DevOps practice and infrastructure? </li><li>Do you have a scalable on-premise or cloud infrastructure? </li><li>Do you have support to use modern tools and technology? </li><li>Is your database ready to be decentralized?  </li><li>Do you have support from all the stakeholders?<p>We discussed this in the <em class="italic">Architecting enterprise microservices</em> section.</p></li></ul></li>
				<li>These are some design patterns:<ul><li>Decomposition by business capability</li><li>Decomposition by domain/sub-domains</li><li>The API Gateway pattern </li><li>The chained microservices pattern</li><li>Database per service </li><li>The command query responsibility segregation pattern</li><li>The service discovery pattern </li><li>The circuit breaker pattern </li><li>The log aggregation pattern <p>We discussed this in the <em class="italic">Design</em> section.</p></li></ul></li>
				<li>The following are a few factors to consider during the design phase of microservices:<ul><li>Design patterns </li><li>Security</li><li>Authentication strategy</li><li>Security rules</li><li>Privilege-based access</li><li>OAuth and SSL</li><li>Privacy-specific standards such as HIPPA, GDPR, and PIPEDA</li><li>Encryption at rest and encryption in transit </li><li>A data retention strategy and log archival strategy</li><li>Local country regulations</li><li>Technology currency/versions<p>We discussed this in the <em class="italic">Design</em> section.</p></li></ul></li>
				<li>The following are a few factors should you consider during the development phase of microservices:<ul><li>Always use the latest stable and supported version for development </li><li>Leverage automation testing </li><li>Test at various levels such as unit testing, service testing, and integration testing</li><li>Use mocking and spying concepts during testing</li><li>Emulate a real-world environment using containers or cloud infrastructure</li><li>Synchronize development, QA, UAT, and PROD environments</li><li>During development, think about backward compatibility for the microservice</li><li>Have a separate database for each microservice to achieve the fullest potential<p>We discussed this in the <em class="italic">Develop</em> section.</p></li></ul></li>
				<li>The following are a few tools that are used in the deployment phase:<ul><li>Containers</li><li>Virtual machines</li><li>The cloud</li><li>Jib</li><li>Jenkins</li><li>DevOps Strategy and infrastructure to support Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery<p>We discussed this in the <em class="italic">Deploy</em> section.</p></li></ul></li>
				<li>The following are a few tools that are used in the manage and maintain phase:<ul><li>Elasticsearch</li><li>Logstash</li><li>Kibana</li><li>Prometheus</li><li>Grafana</li><li>Sonar<p>We discussed this in the <em class="italic">Manage and maintain</em> section.</p></li></ul></li>
				<li>The following are types of scaling:<ul><li>Vertical</li><li>Horizontal</li><li>Microservices horizontal <p>We discussed this in the <em class="italic">Scaling Micronaut</em> section.</p></li></ul></li>
				<li>The tool used is <strong class="bold">Microservices Horizontal</strong> (container/services-based scaling).<p>We discussed this in the <em class="italic">Scaling Micronaut</em> section.</p></li>
