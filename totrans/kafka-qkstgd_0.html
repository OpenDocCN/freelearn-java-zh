<p class="mce-root">Since 2011, Kafka's been exploding in terms of growth. More than one third of Fortune 500 companies use Apache Kafka. These companies include travel companies, banks, insurance companies, and telecom companies.</p>
<p class="mce-root"><span>Uber, Twitter, Netflix, Spotify, Blizzard,</span> LinkedIn, Spotify, and PayPal process their messages with Apache Kafka every day.</p>
<p class="mce-root">Today, Apache Kafka is used <span>to collect data, </span><span>do real-time data analysis, and </span>perform real-time data streaming. Kafka is also used <span>to feed events to <strong>Complex Event Processing</strong> (<strong>CEP</strong>) architectures, is </span>deployed in microservice architectures, and is implemented in <span><strong>Internet of Things</strong> (</span><strong>IoT</strong>) systems.</p>
<p class="mce-root">In the realm of streaming, there are several competitors to Kafka Streams, including Apache Spark, <span>Apache Flink, </span>Akka Streams, Apache Pulsar, and Apache Beam. They are all in competition to perform better than Kafka. However, Apache Kafka has one key advantage over them all: its ease of use. Kafka is easy to implement and maintain, and its learning curve is not very steep.</p>
<p>This book is a practical quick start guide. It is focused on showing practical examples and does not get involved in theoretical explanations or discussions of Kafka's architecture. This book is a compendium of hands-on recipes, solutions to everyday problems faced by those implementing <span>Apache Kafka</span>.</p>

<p class="NormalPACKT">This book is for <span>data engineers, </span>software developers, and data architects looking for a quick hands-on Kafka guide.</p>
<p class="NormalPACKT">This guide is about programming; it is an introduction for those with no previous knowledge about Apache Kafka.</p>
<p class="NormalPACKT"><span>All the examples are written in Java 8; experience with Java 8 is the only requirement for following this guide.</span></p>

                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>There are a number of text conventions used throughout this book.</p>
<p><kbd>CodeInText</kbd>: <span>Indicates c</span>ode words in text, database table names, folder names, filenames, file extensions, pathnames, dummy URLs, user input, and Twitter handles. <span>Here is an example:</span> "<span>The </span><kbd>--topic</kbd><span> parameter sets the name of the topic; in this case, </span><kbd>amazingTopic</kbd>."</p>
<p>A block of code is set as follows:</p>
<pre>{<br/>   "event": "CUSTOMER_CONSULTS_ETHPRICE",<br/>   "customer": {<br/>         "id": "14862768",<br/>         "name": "Snowden, Edward",<br/>         "ipAddress": "95.31.18.111"<br/>   },<br/>   "currency": {<br/>         "name": "ethereum",<br/>         "price": "RUB"<br/>   },<br/>   "timestamp": "2018-09-28T09:09:09Z"<br/>}</pre>
<p>When we wish to draw your attention to a particular part of a code block, the relevant lines or items are set in bold:</p>
<pre>dependencies {<br/>    compile group: 'org.apache.kafka', name: 'kafka_2.12', version:                                                             <br/>                                                          '2.0.0'<br/>    <strong>compile group: 'com.maxmind.geoip', name: 'geoip-api', version: <br/>                                                          '1.3.1'</strong><br/>    compile group: 'com.fasterxml.jackson.core', name: 'jackson-core', version: '2.9.7'<br/>}</pre>
<p>Any command-line input or output is written as follows:</p>
<pre><strong>&gt; &lt;confluent-path&gt;/bin/kafka-topics.sh --list --ZooKeeper localhost:2181</strong></pre>
<p><strong>Bold</strong>: Indicates a new term, an important word, or w<span>ords that you see onscreen. For example, words in menus or dialog boxes appear in the text like this. Here is an example: "To differentiate among them, the events on <strong>t1</strong> have one stripe, the events on <strong>t2</strong> have two stripes, and the events on <strong>t3</strong> have three stripes.</span><span>"</span></p>
<div class="packt_infobox">Warnings or important notes appear like this.</div>
<div class="packt_tip">Tips and tricks appear like this.</div>
