- en: In this chapter, we will look at interoperability between Clojure and both Java
    and JavaScript. Clojure runs on top of platforms provided by Java and JavaScript.
    Clojure was designed to use libraries provided by Java or JavaScript. We will
    learn how to access Java and JavaScript objects and methods in Clojure. We will
    also learn how to convert data between Clojure and Java or JavaScript and back.
    After learning how to access Java and JavaScript from Clojure, we will investigate
    how to perform Input-Output (I/O) operations like reading and writing to files
    using Java classes. We will then learn how to deal with errors and exceptions
    in our code.

    and semantics to access Java and JavaScript objects and methods from Clojure,
    and deal with Java exceptions and JavaScript errors.

    gives a structure for organizing our code. We structure our project around namespaces.
    We created new namespaces and we imported external Clojure libraries in order
    to use them in our code.
  prefs: []

    it is time to become more comfortable with working on projects that use Java and

- en: As we learned in *Chapter 1*, *Hello REPL!*, Clojure compiles to Java bytecode
    and operates on the **Java Virtual Machine** (**JVM**). The JVM is a host platform.
    Any programming language that compiles to Java bytecode can run on the JVM. Because
    Clojure compiles to Java bytecode and runs on the JVM, we call it a hosted language.
    Java dates from the 1990s and is now one of the most popular backend languages.
    We can leverage existing Java libraries instead of writing a lot of code on our
    own. This helps us deliver new features faster.

- en: As we will see, importing Java classes in Clojure is a bit different than using
    Clojure libraries. In this chapter, we will learn how to import and call Java
    classes in Clojure by writing an application that performs I/O operations—reading
    and writing from a file.

    interoperability. JavaScript is a scripting language that runs in browsers. It
    is the most popular frontend language at the moment. ClojureScript compiles to
    JavaScript. In ClojureScript, we can use JavaScript libraries. This gives us access
    to a huge amount of code written by other developers. A great boost to our productivity.

- en: Any code written by a developer needs to be converted to code that is understood
    by a machine. An interpreter uses code from a developer and compiles it into machine
    code. Each operating system is different, hence the need for platform-specific
    compilers and interpreters. One of the reasons why Java is so successful is that
    it provides the JVM, which takes human-understandable code and converts it into
    machine code. Developers are not usually interested in the JVM. They can focus
    on writing code in Java without interacting with the underlying operating system.
    This job is done by the JVM.

- en: Clojure is a hosted language. It means that it uses the JVM instead of creating
    a new runtime environment. Clojure cleverly reuses facilities provided by the
    JVM. This is a very powerful approach. Things such as garbage collection, threading,
    concurrency, IO operations (all of which will be explained in the following paragraphs)
    are JVM battle-tested technologies that Clojure relies on.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Java garbage collection is the process by which Java programs perform automatic
    memory management. Java programs compile to bytecode that can be run on a JVM.
    When Java programs run on a JVM, objects are created on the heap, which is a portion
    of memory dedicated to the program. Eventually, some objects will no longer be
    needed. The garbage collector finds these unused objects and deletes them to free
    up memory. We could have a vector with usernames in our program. The usernames
    are strings. Each string will occupy some space in memory. When we display a list
    of users on a page, we need this list. When we click on a user and display her
    profile, we do not need information about other users. We could remove this information
    from memory so the memory is available for other data.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In concurrent computing several computations and operations are executed during
    overlapping time periods. This is in contrast with sequential programming, where
    one operation must finish before other operations can start. In sequential computing,
    an operation to capitalize a vector of usernames must finish before the second
    operation that finds only admin users can start. In concurrent computing, execution
    of both operations overlaps. We do not need to wait for one to finish before the
    second can start.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A thread is a lightweight process on the JVM. When a computing program uses
    two or more threads, it runs concurrently. Each part of a program is a separate
    thread. In our usernames example, one thread will filter usernames for admins
    while the other thread will capitalize names.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: IO operations are processes that deal with reading from a source, such as a
    keyboard, and writing to a destination, such as a monitor. Java provides support
    for a number of sources and destinations. We can read from a text file and write
    to a printer. Java IO will be covered in this chapter.

- en: As Clojure developers, we have access to an ecosystem of JVM libraries. Because
    Java is one of the most popular languages, by targeting JVM, we join a big community.
    This gives us the benefit of using many well-tested and optimized libraries.

- en: It is common in Java to write a code where it is necessary to make a lot of
    modifications to strings of characters. Consider a situation where we have an
    auto finder on a website. Whenever we type a new character, we need to create
    a new string. With constant typing, this would mean creating many string objects.
    Such objects would occupy lots of memory space. With `StringBuffer`, we create
    one instance and we can add characters to this instance. This saves a lot of memory
    compared to having string objects.

    These are some of the most common activities that programs do. Source and destination
    are very broad concepts. You could read from a file or a keyboard and display
    data on a monitor. You could read from a database and write to an API serving
    data. Java provides classes for many sources and destinations for reading and
    writing data.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I/O is a huge and difficult topic. Even the people that created Java did not
    get it right in the beginning, as we can see from the number of classes and packages
    for I/O. We have the `java.io` package and the `java.nio` (new IO) package. The
    `java.io` package contains classes for working with input and output in Java.
    This package has methods for reading from sources such as the keyboard and displaying
    to destinations such as a printer or a screen. While the `java.io` package contains
    many useful classes, it is considered complicated. In order to write I/O code,
    we have to use many classes. The newer package, `java.nio` (new I/O), introduces
    new I/O classes that simplify working with input and output in Java.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Java has many I/O classes because there are many scenarios for using input and
    output. We will see the `PushbackReader` class in action. This class allows us
    to read ahead a few characters to see what is coming, before we determine how
    to interpret the current character. This is useful when we want to read and interpret
    data by taking into account what other data is in the file.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Luckily for us, Clojure is a very pragmatic language and provides tools to work
    with I/O. Clojure has a `with-open` macro that helps us to work with files. Opening
    a file, or, to be more precise, any stream of data, uses computer resources such
    as CPU and RAM. After finishing reading from a file, we want to free these resources
    so they are available for other tasks. The `with-open` macro closes the opened
    stream, thus freeing up the resources. Closing resources is done automatically,
    and we do not need to think about closing resources ourselves. This prevents our
    application from slowing down or even crashing if we have many opened resources
    that are not used.

    Clojure defaults to immutability. We do not alter data structures but create new
    structures based on existing data. For example, information about employees that
    is stored in a map is updated by creating a new map of employees with the necessary
    changes. The original map of employees is intact and available if we need it.
    As we have learned, this approach prevents many bugs in Clojure when we want to
    access one data structure from many places.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There are times, however, when we want to mutate data. We want to run an application
    by default and stop it when the user selects the exit option. Ref is one of Clojure's
    concurrency primitives. We will learn more about concurrency in Clojure in *Chapter
    12*, *Concurrency*. Now, all we need to know is that with `ref` we can change
    the value of data. We will use ref to control the state of an application that
    we will shortly create.

- en: What is even more amazing is that ClojureScript improves on JavaScript. In JavaScript,
    there is no concept of a namespace. When we define a function or a variable, it
    belongs to a global namespace. This poses a problem when two or more libraries
    use the same name for a variable or a method. This causes a conflict and gives
    us errors. Library designers use JavaScript objects as modules/namespaces and
    place functions in their objects. This is, however, only a workaround and not
    a language design. In ClojureScript, namespaces are first-class citizens designed
    in the language.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We should pay attention to one namespace. ClojureScript uses the `js` namespace
    to refer to the global scope of a program. Core JavaScript objects such as `Number`,
    `String`, and `Date` are accessed in ClojureScript using the `js` namespace. In
    this namespace, we will also find browser-defined objects such as `window`.

    reload function definitions all day long. They are side-effect free and not tied

    many times does not change the state of an application. Recompiling and reloading

    page again. Rendering a whole page consumes computer resources. If only a small
    part of the page needs re-rendering, we waste precious resources re-rendering

    block of React.js is a component. In React.js, we define what components should
    look like and how they should behave. With React.js, we can create components
    based on the current application state. Changes in state result in re-rendering
    components that require a change. React internally checks which parts of the application
    state have changed and which components rely on these parts of state. As a result,
    React re-renders only those components that used parts of the application state
    that have changed.

    users, and based on our actions a web page should update. In Rum, it is possible
    to define page elements such as a user entry that will react to changes to the
    list of users. Adding a new user will result in a page displaying an updated list

    them using the remaining three Java constructs.'

- en: '`try` is a Java reserved word that allows a developer to write a block of code
    that can potentially result in a `Throwable` object appearing. This code is scoped
    within a `try` block and guarded against errors. Going back to our application,
    an age check will be placed inside a `try` block. When we encounter an error or
    exception, we can handle it. The third construct will help us with that.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '`catch` is a reserved word in Java that allows a developer to handle and deal
    with exceptions and errors. The block of code under catch is executed when the
    specified exception or error is encountered. In our example, when we try to manipulate
    an age string such as a number, an exception is thrown and the `catch` block is
    executed. In this block, we could return a message to the user that they need
    to input numbers.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '`finally` is the last reserved word for dealing with exceptions and errors
    in Java. The block of code under `finally` is always executed. There are situations
    when we want to execute code regardless of whether we have encountered an exception
    or not. An example is I/O operations. Opening a file could raise an error if a
    file is not present. If a file is present, an error is not thrown. Opening a file
    uses computer resources such as RAM that we want to free up after we finishing
    reading the file. Closing a file after reading the `finally` block is a common
    practice. It is so common that Clojure provides the `with-open` macro that we
    saw in action in the I/O section of this chapter.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The most common example of a `try-catch-finally` block is reading or writing
    to a file. Inside the `try` block, we have an operation to read or write to a
    file. The `catch` block would guard against IO exceptions such as file not present.
    In the `finally` block, we would have code to close the file. Closing the file
    releases computer resources for other tasks.
