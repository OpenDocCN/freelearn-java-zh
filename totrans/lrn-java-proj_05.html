			<h1 id="_idParaDest-103"><a id="_idTextAnchor103"/>Understanding Iteration</h1>
			<p>In <a href="B19793_04.xhtml#_idTextAnchor087"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 4</em></span></a>, we learned about scope and conditional statements in Java. Scope determines the visibility of identifiers – in other words, where you can use them. Java uses block scope, which is defined by curly braces, <strong class="source-inline">{}</strong>. Scopes can be nested but not <span class="No-Break">vice versa.</span></p>
			<p>We discussed variations of the <strong class="source-inline">if</strong> statement. Each of these statements evaluates a boolean condition, resulting in true or false. If true, then that branch is executed and no other branch is evaluated. If false, then the next branch is evaluated. Unless an else clause is present, it is possible that no branch at all will <span class="No-Break">be executed.</span></p>
			<p>For complex <strong class="source-inline">if</strong> statements, Java supports the more elegant <strong class="source-inline">switch</strong> structure. We examined <strong class="source-inline">switch</strong> statements, with their <em class="italic">fall-through</em> behavior, and the use of the <strong class="source-inline">break</strong> statement. In addition, we discussed <strong class="source-inline">switch</strong> expressions, where a value can be returned, and their use <span class="No-Break">of </span><span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">yield</strong></span><span class="No-Break">.</span></p>
			<p>Now that we understand conditional logic, let us examine iteration (looping). Looping constructs enable us to repeat statements and/or blocks of code a finite number of times while a boolean condition is true or while there are more entries in the array/collection. By the end of this chapter, you will be able to use Java’s <span class="No-Break">looping constructs.</span></p>
			<p>In this chapter, we are going to cover the following <span class="No-Break">main topics:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">while</strong></span><span class="No-Break"> loops</span></li>
				<li><span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">do-while</strong></span><span class="No-Break"> loops</span></li>
				<li><span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">for</strong></span><span class="No-Break"> loops</span></li>
				<li>Enhanced <strong class="source-inline">for</strong> (<span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">for-each</strong></span><span class="No-Break">) loops</span></li>
				<li><strong class="source-inline">break</strong> and <span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">continue</strong></span><span class="No-Break"> statements</span></li>
			</ul>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-104"><a id="_idTextAnchor104"/>Technical requirements</h1>
			<p>The code for this chapter can be found on GitHub <span class="No-Break">at </span><a href="https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Learn-Java-with-Projects/tree/main/ch5"><span class="No-Break">https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Learn-Java-with-Projects/tree/main/ch5</span></a><span class="No-Break">.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-105"><a id="_idTextAnchor105"/>while loops</h1>
			<p>An important feature <a id="_idIndexMarker315"/>of any programming language is the ability to perform an action repeatedly. This is known as “looping”. We may want to repeat a piece of code a finite number of times or until some condition is met; for example, the user typing in a value that signifies that the loop should terminate. In most cases, a boolean expression can be used to determine whether the loop continues <span class="No-Break">or not.</span></p>
			<p>A <strong class="source-inline">while</strong> loop is one such looping construct. It repeatedly executes a statement or a block of code as long as a boolean expression is true. As soon as the boolean expression is false, the loop exits, and the next statement after the <strong class="source-inline">while</strong> <span class="No-Break">loop executes.</span></p>

			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 5.1 – The while loop syntax</p>
			<p>In the preceding figure, we are assuming a block of code, hence the curly braces <strong class="source-inline">{}</strong>. You could, of course, omit the curly braces <strong class="source-inline">{}</strong> and the loop will just repeatedly execute one statement (which ends with a semi-colon). Interestingly, as the boolean expression could be false to begin with, the <strong class="source-inline">while</strong> loop may not execute at all. More formally, a <strong class="source-inline">while</strong> loop executes <em class="italic">zero</em> or more times. Let us look at some examples. <span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Figure 5</em></span><em class="italic">.2</em> presents a simple <span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">while</strong></span><span class="No-Break"> loop:</span></p>

				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 5.2 – A simple while loop</p>
			<p>On line 9 in the preceding figure, a local variable, <strong class="source-inline">x</strong>, is initialized to <strong class="source-inline">1</strong>. Line 11 evaluates the boolean expression, <strong class="source-inline">x &lt;= 3</strong>. As <strong class="source-inline">x</strong> is <strong class="source-inline">1</strong>, the boolean expression is true and the loop executes. Line 12 outputs <strong class="source-inline">"Loop: 1"</strong> and line 13 increments <strong class="source-inline">x</strong> to <strong class="source-inline">2</strong>. The <strong class="source-inline">}</strong> symbol on line 14 is reached and the loop condition (on line 11) is automatically rechecked to see whether it still holds. As <strong class="source-inline">x</strong> is <strong class="source-inline">2</strong> and <strong class="source-inline">2 &lt;= 3</strong>, the condition is true and we re-enter the loop. Line 12 outputs <strong class="source-inline">"Loop: 2"</strong> and line 13 increments <strong class="source-inline">x</strong> to <strong class="source-inline">3</strong>. The end of the block is reached on line 14, and again, the loop continuation expression is re-evaluated. As the expression <strong class="source-inline">3 &lt;= 3</strong> is true, the loop is executed again. Line 12 outputs <strong class="source-inline">"Loop: 3"</strong> and line 13 increments <strong class="source-inline">x</strong> to <strong class="source-inline">4</strong>. Once again, the end of the code block is reached and the loop continuation expression is re-evaluated. As <strong class="source-inline">x</strong> is now <strong class="source-inline">4</strong> and as <strong class="source-inline">4 &lt;= 3</strong> is false, the loop exits. This is shown by line 15 outputting <strong class="source-inline">"Final x value </strong><span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">is: 4"</strong></span><span class="No-Break">.</span></p>
			<p>Note that if, on line 9, <strong class="source-inline">x</strong> had been initialized to <strong class="source-inline">11</strong> (as opposed to <strong class="source-inline">1</strong>), then the initial boolean expression on line 11 would have been evaluated to false and the loop would never have been executed <span class="No-Break">at all.</span></p>
			<p>A <strong class="source-inline">while</strong> loop can be very <a id="_idIndexMarker316"/>useful when you do <em class="italic">not</em> know how many times the loop is going to iterate. For example, the loop continuation expression may be predicated on user input. <span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Figure 5</em></span><em class="italic">.3</em> is one <span class="No-Break">such loop.</span></p>

			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 5.3 – A while loop that ends based on user input</p>
			<p>In the preceding figure, an algorithm for summing up a sequence of positive, user-inputted numbers is presented. The loop will keep going, totaling up the numbers entered by the user, until a negative number is entered. This negative number is naturally, not part of the total. Let us discuss it in <span class="No-Break">more detail.</span></p>
			<p>Line 19 declares a local <strong class="source-inline">int</strong> variable, <strong class="source-inline">sum</strong>, and initializes it to <strong class="source-inline">0</strong>. Line 20 declares a local boolean variable, <strong class="source-inline">keepGoing</strong>, and sets it to true. The boolean expression on line 21 evaluates to true (due to line 20) and, as a result, the loop block executes. Line 22 declares our <strong class="source-inline">Scanner</strong> reference, <strong class="source-inline">sc</strong>, pointing at the keyboard. Line 23 prompts the user to enter a number while informing the user that any negative number terminates the loop. Line 24 uses the <strong class="source-inline">Scanner</strong> method, <strong class="source-inline">nextInt()</strong>, to get an integer (whole number) from the user. This number is stored in the local variable, <strong class="source-inline">n</strong>. Line 25 checks to see whether a negative number has been entered. If so, line 26 sets the <strong class="source-inline">keepGoing</strong> flag to false so that the loop will not execute again. If a non-negative integer was entered by the user, then the number entered, <strong class="source-inline">n</strong>, is added to the running <span class="No-Break">total, </span><span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">sum</strong></span><span class="No-Break">.</span></p>
			<p>Let us walk through an <a id="_idIndexMarker317"/>example. We will add the following numbers: <strong class="source-inline">1</strong>, <strong class="source-inline">2</strong>, and <strong class="source-inline">3</strong>, totaling 6. This is what the screen output <span class="No-Break">looks like:</span></p>
			<pre class="console">
Enter a number (negative number to exit) --&gt;1
Enter a number (negative number to exit) --&gt;
2
Enter a number (negative number to exit) --&gt;
3
Enter a number (negative number to exit) --&gt;
-1
Sum of numbers is: 6</pre>
			<p>Let us examine what is happening in the code. The loop (line 21) is entered because the <strong class="source-inline">keepGoing</strong> boolean was set to true on line 20. We are then prompted for our first number (line 23). We type in <strong class="source-inline">1</strong>, resulting in <strong class="source-inline">n</strong> being initialized to <strong class="source-inline">1</strong> on line 24. As <strong class="source-inline">n</strong> is <strong class="source-inline">1</strong>, the <strong class="source-inline">if</strong> statement on line 25 is false and the <strong class="source-inline">else</strong> block (lines 27-29) is executed; setting <strong class="source-inline">sum</strong> to <strong class="source-inline">1</strong> (0 + <span class="No-Break">1).</span></p>
			<p>The loop block end is reached (line 30) and the loop continuation expression is automatically re-evaluated (line 21). As <strong class="source-inline">keepGoing</strong> is still true, the loop continues. We are prompted for our second number; we enter <strong class="source-inline">2</strong> and <strong class="source-inline">sum</strong> is changed to <strong class="source-inline">3</strong> (1 + <span class="No-Break">2).</span></p>
			<p>The loop block end is reached again and, as <strong class="source-inline">keepGoing</strong> is still true, the loop continues. We are prompted for our next number; we enter <strong class="source-inline">3</strong> and <strong class="source-inline">sum</strong> is changed to <strong class="source-inline">6</strong> (3 + <span class="No-Break">3).</span></p>
			<p>Again, the loop block end is reached and, as <strong class="source-inline">keepGoing</strong> is still true, the loop continues. We are prompted for our next number. This time we enter <strong class="source-inline">-1</strong>. As <strong class="source-inline">n</strong> is now negative, the <strong class="source-inline">if</strong> statement on line 25 is true and <strong class="source-inline">keepGoing</strong> is set to false (line 26). Now, when the loop continuation expression is next evaluated, as <strong class="source-inline">keepGoing</strong> is false, the <span class="No-Break">loop exits.</span></p>
			<p>Lastly, line 31 <a id="_idIndexMarker318"/>outputs <strong class="source-inline">"Sum of numbers </strong><span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">is: 6"</strong></span><span class="No-Break">.</span></p>
			<p>Now that we have covered the <strong class="source-inline">while</strong> loop, let us examine its close relative, the <span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">do-while</strong></span><span class="No-Break"> loop.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-106"><a id="_idTextAnchor106"/>do-while loops</h1>
			<p>As we have seen with the <strong class="source-inline">while</strong> loop, the boolean loop continuation expression is at the start of the loop. Though similar to the <strong class="source-inline">while</strong> loop, the <strong class="source-inline">do-while</strong> loop is different in one critical <a id="_idIndexMarker319"/>aspect: in the <strong class="source-inline">do-while</strong> loop, the loop continuation expression is at the <em class="italic">end</em> of the loop. Thus, the <strong class="source-inline">do-while</strong> loop is executed at least <em class="italic">once</em>. More formally, a <strong class="source-inline">do-while</strong> loop executes <em class="italic">one</em> or <span class="No-Break">more times.</span></p>
			<p> <span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Figure 5</em></span><em class="italic">.4</em> presents the syntax of the <span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">do-while</strong></span><span class="No-Break"> loop.</span></p>

			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 5.4 – The do-while loop syntax</p>
			<p>As can be seen in the preceding figure, the loop continuation expression is at the end of the loop, after one loop iteration.

			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 5.5 – A do-while loop that ends based on user input</p>
			<p>In the preceding figure, the only differences with <span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Figure 5</em></span><em class="italic">.2</em> are lines 21 and 30. On line 21, we simply enter the loop as, unlike in the <strong class="source-inline">while</strong> loop, there is no condition preventing us from doing <a id="_idIndexMarker320"/>so. Line 30 checks to see whether it is okay to re-enter the loop. The rest of the code is the same and the execution is <span class="No-Break">the same.</span></p>
			<p>While (pardon the pun) the two examples given have no material difference in the outcome, let us examine a situation where using a <strong class="source-inline">while</strong> loop as opposed to a <strong class="source-inline">do-while</strong> loop <span class="No-Break">is preferable.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-107"><a id="_idTextAnchor107"/>while versus do-while</h2>
			<p>As already stated, a <strong class="source-inline">do-while</strong> loop executes at least once, whereas a <strong class="source-inline">while</strong> loop may not execute <a id="_idIndexMarker321"/>at all. This can be very useful in certain situations. Let us <a id="_idIndexMarker322"/>look at one such example. <span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Figure 5</em></span><em class="italic">.6</em> presents a <strong class="source-inline">while</strong> loop that checks to see whether a person is of the legal age to purchase alcohol (which is 18 <span class="No-Break">in Ireland).</span></p>

				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 5.6 – A while loop to prevent underage purchasing of alcohol</p>
			<p>In the preceding figure, line 49 declares the <strong class="source-inline">Scanner</strong> and points it at the keyboard so we can get user input. Line 50 prompts the user to enter their age. Line 51 takes in the user input and stores it in a local variable, namely <strong class="source-inline">age</strong>. Line 52 is important. The condition prevents the loop from being executed with an invalid <strong class="source-inline">age</strong>. The loop itself is trivial and simply outputs a message that includes the <strong class="source-inline">age</strong> so we can validate that the loop is <span class="No-Break">executing properly.</span></p>
			<p>Lines 57 to 58 are very important in that they enable us to prompt and get a new <strong class="source-inline">age</strong> from the user. The code deliberately overwrites the <strong class="source-inline">age</strong> variable. If we did not, then <strong class="source-inline">age</strong> would remain as the first value entered by the user and we would have an infinite loop. So, the first age is entered before the <strong class="source-inline">while</strong> loop is entered and every other age is entered at the end of the loop. This is a common pattern in <strong class="source-inline">while</strong> loops. The condition on line 52 prevents any <strong class="source-inline">age</strong> inputthat is &lt; 18, from entering <span class="No-Break">the loop.</span></p>
			<p>Here is the first run of the code in <span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Figure 5</em></span><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">.6</em></span><span class="No-Break">:</span></p>
			<pre class="console">
Please enter your age -- &gt;21
As you are 21 years of age, you can purchase alcohol.
Please enter your age -- &gt;
12</pre>
			<p>The first two lines: the prompt and user input, are before the <strong class="source-inline">while</strong> loop and, as 21 &gt;= 18, we enter the loop. The message <strong class="source-inline">As you are 21 years of age, you can purchase alcohol.</strong> is perfectly correct. The last two lines: repeating the prompt and user input, are from the bottom of the loop. We have entered <strong class="source-inline">12</strong>, which causes the <strong class="source-inline">while</strong> loop <span class="No-Break">to terminate.</span></p>
			<p>The following is the output if, when prompted for the first age, we <span class="No-Break">enter </span><span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">12</strong></span><span class="No-Break">:</span></p>
			<pre class="console">
Please enter your age -- &gt;12
Process finished with exit code 0</pre>
			<p>Importantly, the <a id="_idIndexMarker323"/>message about purchasing alcohol <a id="_idIndexMarker324"/>does <span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">not</em></span><span class="No-Break"> appear.</span></p>
			<p>Now, let us look at the <strong class="source-inline">do-while</strong> version. <span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Figure 5</em></span><em class="italic">.7</em> presents the <strong class="source-inline">do-while</strong> version of the <strong class="source-inline">while</strong> loop in <span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Figure 5</em></span><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">.6</em></span><span class="No-Break">.</span></p>

			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 5.7 – A do-while loop to prevent underage purchasing of alcohol</p>
			<p>In the interests of having as much of the code as similar as possible, lines 49 to 51 are untouched. Lines 52 and 59 are all that have changed. The condition is now at the end of the loop, after one iteration of the loop. This has implications when we start with an age of <strong class="source-inline">12</strong>, as can be seen in <span class="No-Break">the output:</span></p>
			<pre class="console">
Please enter your age -- &gt;12
<strong class="bold">As you are 12 years of age, you can purchase alcohol.</strong>
Please enter your age -- &gt;
12
Process finished with exit code 0</pre>
			<p>The third line in the output is the issue. Obviously, 12 is too young to buy alcohol but the <strong class="source-inline">do-while</strong> loop would <a id="_idIndexMarker325"/>require an <strong class="source-inline">if</strong> statement to protect its code, whereas <a id="_idIndexMarker326"/>the <strong class="source-inline">while</strong> loop provides that protection automatically. Therefore, in this example, there is a material advantage in using the <strong class="source-inline">while</strong> loop over the <span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">do-while</strong></span><span class="No-Break"> loop.</span></p>
			<p>Now that we have covered <strong class="source-inline">while</strong> and <strong class="source-inline">do-while</strong> loops, let us now discuss <span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">for</strong></span><span class="No-Break"> loops.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-108"><a id="_idTextAnchor108"/>for loops</h1>
			<p>The <strong class="source-inline">for</strong> loop comes in <a id="_idIndexMarker327"/>two styles: the <em class="italic">traditional</em> <strong class="source-inline">for</strong> loop and the <em class="italic">enhanced</em> <strong class="source-inline">for</strong> loop. The enhanced <strong class="source-inline">for</strong> loop is also known as the <strong class="source-inline">for-each</strong> loop and is specifically designed to work with arrays and collections. We will start by examining the traditional <span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">for</strong></span><span class="No-Break"> loop.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-109"><a id="_idTextAnchor109"/>Traditional for loop</h2>
			<p>This type of <strong class="source-inline">for</strong> loop is <a id="_idIndexMarker328"/>extremely useful when you know how many <a id="_idIndexMarker329"/>iterations you wish to perform beforehand. Its syntax is detailed in <span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Figure 5</em></span><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">.8</em></span><span class="No-Break">.</span></p>

			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 5.8 – The traditional for loop</p>
			<p>The code block in the preceding figure is optional. We could simply control one statement, such as <strong class="source-inline">System.out.println("Looping");</strong>, and omit <strong class="source-inline">{}</strong>. The <strong class="source-inline">for</strong> header is the section inside <strong class="source-inline">()</strong>. It consists of three parts, delimited <span class="No-Break">by semi-colons:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Initialization section</strong>: This is where you initialize your loop control variables. The variables declared here have the scope of the loop block <em class="italic">only</em>. Traditionally, the variables declared here are named <strong class="source-inline">i</strong>, <strong class="source-inline">j</strong>, <strong class="source-inline">k</strong>, and <span class="No-Break">so forth.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Boolean expression</strong>: This determines whether the loop should be executed and is checked before every iteration, including the first one. Sound familiar? Yes, you are correct, a <strong class="source-inline">while</strong> loop and a traditional <strong class="source-inline">for</strong> loop <span class="No-Break">are interchangeable.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Increment/decrement section</strong>: This is where you increment/decrement your loop control variables (declared in the initialization section) so that the <span class="No-Break">loop terminates.</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>We must <a id="_idIndexMarker330"/>understand the order of execution of the loop. In other words, which <a id="_idIndexMarker331"/>part is executed and when. <span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Figure 5</em></span><em class="italic">.9</em>, which presents a simple <strong class="source-inline">for</strong> loop, will help in <span class="No-Break">this regard.</span></p>

				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 5.11 – Additional traditional for loops</p>
			<p>In the first loop of the preceding figure (lines 20-22), the important thing to notice is the <strong class="source-inline">;</strong> symbol, which is just after the <strong class="source-inline">)</strong> symbol of the <strong class="source-inline">for</strong> header. This loop controls an empty statement! Even though the indentation may suggest otherwise, the block of code that follows has nothing to do with the loop at all, and as a result, <strong class="source-inline">"Looping"</strong> appears only once in the output. In effect, the loop iterates three times, doing nothing each time. The block of code surrounding line 21 is not predicated on any condition and just executes once (<span class="No-Break">as normal).</span></p>
			<p>In the second loop (lines 24-26), the loop control variable, <strong class="source-inline">i</strong>, starts out at <strong class="source-inline">10</strong> and goes up in increments of 10 until it reaches <strong class="source-inline">60</strong>, at which point the loop terminates. Each valid value of <strong class="source-inline">i</strong> is output to the screen – in other words, <strong class="source-inline">10</strong>, <strong class="source-inline">20</strong>, <strong class="source-inline">30</strong>, <strong class="source-inline">40</strong>, and <strong class="source-inline">50</strong>. Note that line 27 does <em class="italic">not</em> compile, as each of the <strong class="source-inline">i</strong> variables declared in the preceding loops only have the scope of their <a id="_idIndexMarker336"/>individual loop. For example, the <strong class="source-inline">i</strong> variable declared <a id="_idIndexMarker337"/>on line 20 is only available until line 22; similarly, the <strong class="source-inline">i</strong> variable declared on line 24 is only available until line 26. Note: obviously, line 27 must be commented out for the code to compile <span class="No-Break">and run.</span></p>
			<p>The last loop (lines 29-31) shows that we can declare multiple loop control variables and use them throughout the loop. In this loop, we declare <strong class="source-inline">i</strong> and <strong class="source-inline">j</strong> and initialize them both to <strong class="source-inline">0</strong>. The boolean expression is true as both <strong class="source-inline">i &lt; 1</strong> and <strong class="source-inline">j &lt; 1</strong> are true (true &amp;&amp; true == true). Thus, we execute the loop and output <strong class="source-inline">0</strong> and <strong class="source-inline">0</strong>. Both <strong class="source-inline">i</strong> and <strong class="source-inline">j</strong> are then incremented to <strong class="source-inline">1</strong>. The loop condition fails and the <span class="No-Break">loop terminates.</span></p>
			<p>While arrays will be discussed in detail in <a href="B19793_06.xhtml#_idTextAnchor118"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 6</em></span></a>, <strong class="source-inline">for</strong> loops are such a natural fit for arrays that we have <a id="_idIndexMarker338"/>inserted some examples here as well. Let us first <a id="_idIndexMarker339"/>examine how a traditional <strong class="source-inline">for</strong> loop can be used to process <span class="No-Break">an array.</span></p>
			<h3>Processing an array</h3>
			<p>Any <strong class="source-inline">for</strong> loop is useful for iterating over an array. An array is simply an area of memory set aside and given an identifier name for ease of <a id="_idIndexMarker340"/>reference. An array consists of elements which are organized in consecutive memory locations – in other words, the array elements are right beside each other in memory. This makes it easy to process arrays <span class="No-Break">using loops.</span></p>
			<p>Each element in an array is accessed by an index. Crucially, array indices start at <strong class="source-inline">0</strong> and go up in steps of 1. Therefore, the last valid index is the size of the array minus one. For example, an array of size <strong class="source-inline">5</strong> has valid indices of <strong class="source-inline">0</strong>, <strong class="source-inline">1</strong>, <strong class="source-inline">2</strong>, <strong class="source-inline">3</strong>, and <strong class="source-inline">4</strong>. <span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Figure 5</em></span><em class="italic">.12</em> is a loop processing <span class="No-Break">an array.</span></p>

			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 5.12 – Processing an array using a traditional for loop</p>
			<p>In this <a id="_idIndexMarker341"/>figure, line 33 declares an <strong class="source-inline">int</strong> array <a id="_idIndexMarker342"/>containing the values <strong class="source-inline">1</strong>, <strong class="source-inline">2</strong>, and <strong class="source-inline">3</strong> in indices <strong class="source-inline">0</strong>, <strong class="source-inline">1</strong>, and <strong class="source-inline">2</strong>, respectively. The length of the array, accessible using the <strong class="source-inline">length</strong> property, is <strong class="source-inline">3</strong>. The <strong class="source-inline">for</strong> loop (lines 34-35) processes the array, outputting each location one by one. Thus, when <strong class="source-inline">i</strong> is <strong class="source-inline">0</strong>, <strong class="source-inline">ia[0]</strong> outputs <strong class="source-inline">1</strong> to the screen; when <strong class="source-inline">i</strong> is <strong class="source-inline">1</strong>, <strong class="source-inline">ia[1]</strong> outputs <strong class="source-inline">2</strong>, and when <strong class="source-inline">i</strong> is <strong class="source-inline">2</strong>, <strong class="source-inline">ia[2]</strong> <span class="No-Break">outputs </span><span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">3</strong></span><span class="No-Break">.</span></p>
			<p>Now that we have covered the traditional <strong class="source-inline">for</strong> loop, let us examine the enhanced <span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">for</strong></span><span class="No-Break"> loop.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-110"><a id="_idTextAnchor110"/>Enhanced for loop</h2>
			<p>As stated earlier, the <a id="_idIndexMarker343"/>enhanced <strong class="source-inline">for</strong> loop, also known as the <strong class="source-inline">for-each</strong> loop, is <a id="_idIndexMarker344"/>ideal for processing arrays and/or collections. We will discuss collections is detail in <a href="B19793_13.xhtml#_idTextAnchor317"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 13</em></span></a>. For the moment, just imagine a collection as a <em class="italic">list </em>of items. The enhanced <strong class="source-inline">for</strong> loop enables you to iterate over the list one element at a time. The syntax of the enhanced <strong class="source-inline">for</strong> loop is outlined in <span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Figure 5</em></span><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">.13</em></span><span class="No-Break">.</span></p>
			<div>

				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 5.13 – Enhanced for loop syntax</p>
			<p>In the preceding figure, we can see that a variable is declared. The variables type matches the type of array/collection. For example, if the array is an array of <strong class="source-inline">String</strong>, then <strong class="source-inline">String</strong> is the data type of the variable. The variable name is of course, up to us. Again, the code block <span class="No-Break">is optional.</span></p>
			<p>Let us look at an example to help explain further. <span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Figure 5</em></span><em class="italic">.14</em> is an enhanced <strong class="source-inline">for</strong> loop version of the traditional <strong class="source-inline">for</strong> loop presented in <span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Figure 5</em></span><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">.12</em></span><span class="No-Break">.</span></p>

			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 5.14 – Processing an array using an enhanced for loop</p>
			<p>In this figure, line 38 reads as follows: <em class="italic">for each int n in (the array) ia</em>. Thus, on the first iteration, <strong class="source-inline">n</strong> is <strong class="source-inline">1</strong>; on the second iteration, <strong class="source-inline">n</strong> is <strong class="source-inline">2</strong>, and on the last iteration, <strong class="source-inline">n</strong> is <strong class="source-inline">3</strong>. In the enhanced <strong class="source-inline">for</strong> loop, we <a id="_idIndexMarker345"/>do not have to keep track of a loop control variable <a id="_idIndexMarker346"/>ourselves. While this is useful, be aware that you are limited to starting at the beginning of the array/collection and progressing one element at a time, until you reach the end. With the traditional <strong class="source-inline">for</strong> loop, none of these <span class="No-Break">restrictions apply.</span></p>
			<p>However, with the traditional <strong class="source-inline">for</strong> loop, if you code the increment/decrement section incorrectly, you could end up in an infinite loop. This is not possible in the enhanced <span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">for</strong></span><span class="No-Break"> version.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-111"><a id="_idTextAnchor111"/>Nested loops</h2>
			<p>Loops can, of course, be nested. In <a id="_idIndexMarker347"/>other words, loops can be coded within <a id="_idIndexMarker348"/>other loops. <span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Figure 5</em></span><em class="italic">.15</em> presents one <span class="No-Break">such example.</span></p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer072" class="IMG---Figure">

			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 5.15 – Nested for loops</p>
			<p>The output from this program is presented in <span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Figure 5</em></span><em class="italic">.16</em>. In the preceding figure, we are representing an array of <strong class="source-inline">int </strong>values, namely <strong class="source-inline">data</strong>, as a histogram (represented as a row of stars). The array is declared on line 12. Line 14 outputs a line of text so the output from the <a id="_idIndexMarker349"/>program is easier to interpret. The output has three columns: the <a id="_idIndexMarker350"/>current array index, the value in the <strong class="source-inline">data</strong> array at that index, and the histogram. Note that the output is tab-delimited. This is achieved by the use of the <strong class="source-inline">\t</strong> <span class="No-Break">escape sequence.</span></p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Escape sequences</p>
			<p class="callout">An escape sequence is a character preceded by a backslash. For example, <strong class="source-inline">\t</strong> is a valid escape sequence. When <a id="_idIndexMarker351"/>the compiler sees <strong class="source-inline">\</strong>, it peeks ahead at the next character and checks to see whether the two characters together form a valid escape sequence. Popular escape sequences are <span class="No-Break">as follows:</span></p>
			<p class="callout">   <strong class="source-inline">\t</strong>: Insert a tab at this point in <span class="No-Break">the text</span></p>
			<p class="callout">   <strong class="source-inline">\b</strong>: Insert a backspace at this point in <span class="No-Break">the text</span></p>
			<p class="callout">   <strong class="source-inline">\n</strong>: Insert a newline at this point in <span class="No-Break">the text</span></p>
			<p class="callout">   <strong class="source-inline">\"</strong>: Insert a double quote at this point in <span class="No-Break">the text</span></p>
			<p class="callout">   <strong class="source-inline">\\</strong>: Insert a backslash at this point in <span class="No-Break">the text</span></p>
			<p class="callout">They can be very useful in certain situations. For example, if we wanted to output the text <em class="italic">My name is “Alan”</em> (including the double quotes) to the screen, we <span class="No-Break">would say:</span></p>
			<p class="callout">     <strong class="source-inline">System.out.println("My name </strong><span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">is \"Alan\"");</strong></span></p>
			<p class="callout">If we did not escape the double quote before the <strong class="source-inline">A</strong> in <strong class="source-inline">Alan</strong> (in other words, if we tried <strong class="source-inline">System.out.println("My name is "Alan"");</strong>), then the double quote  before the <strong class="source-inline">A</strong> would have been matched with the first <strong class="source-inline">"</strong> at the start of the string. This would have resulted in a compiler error with the <strong class="source-inline">A</strong> <span class="No-Break">in </span><span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">Alan</strong></span><span class="No-Break">.</span></p>
			<p class="callout">By escaping the double quote before the <strong class="source-inline">A</strong> in <strong class="source-inline">Alan</strong>, the compiler no longer treats that double quote as an end-of-string double quote and instead inserts <strong class="source-inline">"</strong> into the string to be output. The same happens to the double quote after the <strong class="source-inline">n</strong> in <strong class="source-inline">Alan</strong>–it is also escaped and therefore ignored as an end-of-string double quote and inserted into the string to be output. The double quote just before the <strong class="source-inline">)</strong> is not escaped however, and is used to match the opening double quote for the string, namely the one just after <span class="No-Break">the </span><span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">(</strong></span><span class="No-Break">.</span></p>
			<p>The outer loop (lines 15-21) loops through the <strong class="source-inline">data</strong> array. As the array has 4 elements, the valid indices are <strong class="source-inline">0</strong>, <strong class="source-inline">1</strong>, <strong class="source-inline">2</strong>, and <strong class="source-inline">3</strong>. These are the values that the <strong class="source-inline">i</strong> loop control variable, declared on <a id="_idIndexMarker352"/>line 15, will represent. Line 16 outputs two of the columns: the current <a id="_idIndexMarker353"/>array index and the value at that index in the <strong class="source-inline">data</strong> array. For example, when <strong class="source-inline">i</strong> is <strong class="source-inline">0</strong> , <strong class="source-inline">data[0]</strong> is <strong class="source-inline">9</strong>, so <strong class="source-inline">"0\t9\t"</strong> is output; when <strong class="source-inline">i</strong> is <strong class="source-inline">1</strong>, <strong class="source-inline">data[1]</strong> is <strong class="source-inline">3</strong>, so <strong class="source-inline">"1\t3\t"</strong> is output, and <span class="No-Break">so forth.</span></p>
			<p>The inner loop (lines 17-19) outputs the actual histogram as a horizontal row of stars. The inner loop control variable, <strong class="source-inline">j</strong>, goes from <strong class="source-inline">1</strong> to the value of <strong class="source-inline">data[i]</strong>. So, for example, if <strong class="source-inline">i</strong> is <strong class="source-inline">0</strong>, <strong class="source-inline">data[i]</strong> is <strong class="source-inline">9</strong>; therefore, <strong class="source-inline">j</strong> goes from <strong class="source-inline">1</strong> to <strong class="source-inline">9</strong>, outputting a star each time. Note that the <strong class="source-inline">print()</strong> method is used as opposed to <strong class="source-inline">println()</strong> – this is because <strong class="source-inline">println()</strong> automatically brings you on to the next line, whereas <strong class="source-inline">print()</strong> does not. As we want the stars to output horizontally, <strong class="source-inline">print()</strong> is exactly what we need. When we have our row of stars output, we execute <strong class="source-inline">System.out.println()</strong> (line 20), which brings us on to the <span class="No-Break">next line.</span></p>

			<p>In this figure, you can see that <a id="_idIndexMarker354"/>the first column is the array index. The second column is the value <a id="_idIndexMarker355"/>in the <strong class="source-inline">data</strong> array at that index, and the third column is the histogram of stars based on the second column. So, for example, when <strong class="source-inline">i</strong> is <strong class="source-inline">2</strong>, <strong class="source-inline">data[2]</strong> is <strong class="source-inline">5</strong>, and we output a histogram of <span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">5</strong></span><span class="No-Break"> stars.</span></p>
			<p>Now that we understand loops, we will move on to two keywords that are particularly relevant to loops, namely <strong class="source-inline">break</strong> <span class="No-Break">and </span><span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">continue</strong></span><span class="No-Break">.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-112"><a id="_idTextAnchor112"/>break and continue statements</h1>
			<p>Both the <strong class="source-inline">break</strong> and <strong class="source-inline">continue</strong> statements can be used in loops but with very different semantics. In the code examples presented, nested loops will be used to contrast the labeled versions with the non-labeled versions. We will start with the <span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">break</strong></span><span class="No-Break"> statement.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-113"><a id="_idTextAnchor113"/>break statements</h2>
			<p>We have already <a id="_idIndexMarker356"/>encountered <strong class="source-inline">break</strong> in <strong class="source-inline">switch</strong> statements.

			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 5.17 – Showing break inside a loop</p>
			<p>In this figure, the outer loop, controlled by <strong class="source-inline">i</strong>, loops from <strong class="source-inline">1</strong> to <strong class="source-inline">3</strong> in steps of 1. The inner loop, controlled by <strong class="source-inline">j</strong>, loops from <strong class="source-inline">1</strong> to <strong class="source-inline">5</strong> in steps <span class="No-Break">of 1.</span></p>
			<p>The <strong class="source-inline">if</strong> statement on line 16 becomes true when <strong class="source-inline">j</strong> is <strong class="source-inline">3</strong>. At this point, the <strong class="source-inline">break</strong> statement on line 17 is executed. A <strong class="source-inline">break</strong> without a label exits the nearest enclosing loop. In other words, the <strong class="source-inline">break</strong> on line 17 refers to the loop on line 15 (controlled by <strong class="source-inline">j</strong>). As there is no code between the closing <strong class="source-inline">}</strong> of both loops (lines 20 and 21), when <strong class="source-inline">break</strong> is executed in this program, the next line of code executed is the <strong class="source-inline">}</strong> for the outer <a id="_idIndexMarker357"/>loop (line 21). Automatically, the next iteration of the outer loop, <strong class="source-inline">i++</strong> (line 14), starts. In effect, there is never any <strong class="source-inline">j</strong> value of <strong class="source-inline">3</strong> or higher in the output because, when <strong class="source-inline">j</strong> is <strong class="source-inline">3</strong>, we <strong class="source-inline">break </strong>out of the inner loop and start with the next value of <strong class="source-inline">i</strong>. The output <span class="No-Break">reflects this:</span></p>
			<pre class="console">
i, j1, 1
1, 2
2, 1
2, 2
3, 1

			<p>Without any break statement, in other words, if we had commented out lines 16 to 18, the output would be as follows (note the values of <strong class="source-inline">j</strong> go from 1 <span class="No-Break">to 5):</span></p>

			<h3>Label</h3>
			<p>A label is a case-sensitive <a id="_idIndexMarker359"/>identifier followed by a colon that immediately precedes the loop being identified.

			<p>Now let us look at the labeled <span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">break</strong></span><span class="No-Break"> itself.</span></p>
			<h3>Labeled break</h3>
			<p>A <strong class="source-inline">break</strong> that uses a label exits the loop identified by that label. The labeled <strong class="source-inline">break</strong> statement must be in the <a id="_idIndexMarker360"/>scope of the loop identified. In other <a id="_idIndexMarker361"/>words, you cannot <strong class="source-inline">break </strong>to a loop somewhere else in the code, completely unrelated to the current scope. <span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Figure 5</em></span><em class="italic">.18</em> is closely related to the code in <span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Figure 5</em></span><em class="italic">.17</em>, except this time, a label and a labeled <strong class="source-inline">break</strong> <span class="No-Break">are used.</span></p>

Note that it is a compiler error to have any code between the label and the loop. That is why line 25 precedes <span class="No-Break">the label.</span></p>
			<p>The loop control variables, <strong class="source-inline">i</strong> and <strong class="source-inline">j</strong>, behave as before; <strong class="source-inline">i</strong> goes from <strong class="source-inline">1</strong> to <strong class="source-inline">3</strong> in steps of 1, and within <a id="_idIndexMarker362"/>each step of <strong class="source-inline">i</strong>, <strong class="source-inline">j</strong> goes from <strong class="source-inline">1</strong> to <strong class="source-inline">5</strong> in steps of 1. This time, however, <a id="_idIndexMarker363"/>when <strong class="source-inline">j</strong> is <strong class="source-inline">3</strong> in the inner loop, rather than breaking out of the inner loop, we are breaking out of the outer loop. After the labeled <strong class="source-inline">break</strong> (line 30) is executed, there are no more iterations of <strong class="source-inline">i</strong> and the next line executed is <strong class="source-inline">System.out.println("here")</strong> on line 35. As a result, the output is <span class="No-Break">as follows:</span></p>
			<pre class="console">
i, j1, 1
1, 2
here</pre>
			<p>As can be seen, once <strong class="source-inline">j</strong> reaches <strong class="source-inline">3</strong>, the outer loop exits, and <strong class="source-inline">here</strong> <span class="No-Break">is output.</span></p>
			<p>Now, let us look at <span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">continue</strong></span><span class="No-Break"> statements.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-114"><a id="_idTextAnchor114"/>continue statements</h2>
			<p>A <strong class="source-inline">continue</strong> statement can only <a id="_idIndexMarker364"/>occur inside a loop. When executed, <strong class="source-inline">continue</strong> says “skip to the <em class="italic">next</em> iteration” of the loop. Any other statements remaining in the current iteration are bypassed. There is a labeled version also. We will examine the unlabeled version first. <span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Figure 5</em></span><em class="italic">.19</em> presents an example <span class="No-Break">of </span><span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">continue</strong></span><span class="No-Break">.</span></p>

			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 5.19 – A continue example</p>
			<p>In the preceding figure, the nested loops are the same as before – the outer loop iterates from <strong class="source-inline">1</strong> to <strong class="source-inline">3</strong>; within that, the inner loop iterates from <strong class="source-inline">1</strong> to <strong class="source-inline">5</strong>. On this occasion, when <strong class="source-inline">j</strong> is <strong class="source-inline">3</strong>, we execute <strong class="source-inline">continue</strong>. What that means is that we jump to the end of the loop and the next statement executed is <strong class="source-inline">j++</strong>. This means that as line 38 is skipped, j with a value of 3 will never be output. The output <span class="No-Break">demonstrates this:</span></p>
			<pre class="console">
i, j1, 1
1, 2
1, 4
1, 5
2, 1
2, 2
2, 4
2, 5
3, 1
3, 2
3, 4
3, 5</pre>
			<p>As can be <a id="_idIndexMarker365"/>seen, <strong class="source-inline">j</strong> with a value of <strong class="source-inline">3</strong> is never output. Now, let us examine the <span class="No-Break">labeled </span><span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">continue</strong></span><span class="No-Break">.</span></p>
			<h3>labeled continue</h3>
			<p>A <strong class="source-inline">continue</strong> that uses <a id="_idIndexMarker366"/>a label continues the next iteration of the loop identified by that label. All other <a id="_idIndexMarker367"/>statements are bypassed. As with the labeled <strong class="source-inline">break</strong>, the labeled <strong class="source-inline">continue</strong> must be in the scope of the loop identified. <span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Figure 5</em></span><em class="italic">.20</em> is closely related to the code in <span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Figure 5</em></span><em class="italic">.19</em>, except this time, a label and a labeled <strong class="source-inline">continue</strong> <span class="No-Break">are used.</span></p>

			<p>In this figure, line 29 gives the <strong class="source-inline">OUTERLOOP</strong> label to the outer loop starting on line 30. Now, when <strong class="source-inline">j</strong> is <strong class="source-inline">3</strong> and <strong class="source-inline">continue OUTERLOOP</strong> executes, the next line to code to execute is <strong class="source-inline">i++</strong>. Thus, every time <strong class="source-inline">j</strong> reaches <strong class="source-inline">3</strong>, we start with the next value of <strong class="source-inline">i</strong>. So, there are no values of <strong class="source-inline">j</strong> greater than <strong class="source-inline">2</strong> output, as can be seen in <span class="No-Break">the output:</span></p>

			<p>That completes our <a id="_idIndexMarker368"/>explanations on the various looping constructs <a id="_idIndexMarker369"/>and the <strong class="source-inline">break</strong> and <strong class="source-inline">continue</strong> statements used with them. Let us now put that knowledge into practice to reinforce <span class="No-Break">the concepts.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-115"><a id="_idTextAnchor115"/>Exercises</h1>
			<p>Now that we can iterate, it’s time to do some similar tasks to the chapters before but iterate for <span class="No-Break">multiple values!</span></p>
			<p>Be creative on how to implement these ones and add context where you need it. As always, there’s not one <span class="No-Break">right answer:</span></p>
			<ol>
				<li>All of our dinosaurs are unique. Okay, we cloned their DNA, but still. Let’s say they have unique personalities. That’s why the IDs of all our dinosaurs are unique too: they are called <strong class="source-inline">dino1</strong>, <strong class="source-inline">dino2</strong>, <strong class="source-inline">dino3</strong>, and so on. Write a <strong class="source-inline">for</strong> loop that prints out the IDs of the first 100 dinosaurs in <span class="No-Break">the park.</span></li>
				<li>Some of our dinosaurs have large appetites! Write a <strong class="source-inline">do-while</strong> loop that continues to feed a dinosaur until it is no <span class="No-Break">longer hungry.</span></li>
				<li>We all love the thrill of waiting for the park to open. Use a <strong class="source-inline">while</strong> loop to print out a countdown to the park’s <span class="No-Break">opening time.</span></li>
				<li>For planning purposes, it’s essential to know the total weight of all dinosaurs in a specific enclosure. Write a <strong class="source-inline">for</strong> loop that <span class="No-Break">calculates this.</span></li>
				<li>Ticket selling can get hectic during the peak season. Write a <strong class="source-inline">while</strong> loop that simulates the park’s ticket-selling process until tickets are <span class="No-Break">sold out.</span></li>
				<li>Security is our topmost priority. Use a <strong class="source-inline">do-while</strong> loop to simulate a security check process that continues until all security measures <span class="No-Break">are met.</span></li>
			</ol>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-116"><a id="_idTextAnchor116"/>Project – Dino meal planner</h1>
			<p>Dinosaurs are not easy <a id="_idIndexMarker370"/>animals to keep. This is very advanced pet ownership. The right nutrition is difficult to manage, but it’s vital to their health and well-being. Therefore, you are asked to create a system that can manage the feeding schedule of our various <span class="No-Break">dinosaur residents.</span></p>
			<p>The project’s primary goal is to create a program that calculates the meal portions and feeding times for each dinosaur. Since we haven’t covered arrays yet, we’ll focus on a single dinosaur <span class="No-Break">for now.</span></p>
			<p>Here’s how we can <span class="No-Break">do it:</span></p>
			<ol>
				<li>Start by declaring a variable to hold the current time; let’s say it’s an integer and it goes from <strong class="source-inline">0</strong> (midnight) to <strong class="source-inline">23</strong> (last hour of <span class="No-Break">the day).</span></li>
				<li>Define variables for each dinosaur species with different feeding times. For example, T-Rex could eat at 8 (morning), 14 (afternoon), and 20 (evening), while the Brachiosaurus could eat at 7 (morning), 11 (mid-morning), 15 (afternoon), and <span class="No-Break">19 (evening).</span></li>
				<li>Next, establish<a id="_idIndexMarker371"/> a conditional statement (such as an <strong class="source-inline">if-else</strong> block) to check whether it’s feeding time for each species, comparing the current time with their <span class="No-Break">feeding times.</span></li>
				<li>Now, let’s define the feeding portions for our dinosaurs. We can assume that each species requires a different amount of food, depending on their sizes. For instance, the T-Rex requires 100 kg of food per meal, while the Brachiosaurus requires 250 kg of food <span class="No-Break">per meal.</span></li>
				<li>Similarly, using an <strong class="source-inline">if-else</strong> block, check which species you are dealing with and assign the food <span class="No-Break">portions accordingly.</span></li>
				<li>Finally, print the result. For instance, <strong class="source-inline">"It's 8:00 - Feeding time for T-Rex with 100kg </strong><span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">of food"</strong></span><span class="No-Break">.</span></li>
				<li>Wrap all of the preceding information inside a loop that runs from <strong class="source-inline">0</strong> to <strong class="source-inline">23</strong>, simulating the 24 hours in <span class="No-Break">a day.</span></li>
			</ol>
			<p>On behalf of the hungry dinosaurs in the park: thank you so much for putting your Java skills <span class="No-Break">to use!</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-117"><a id="_idTextAnchor117"/>Summary</h1>
			<p>In this chapter, we discussed how Java implements iteration (looping). We started with the <strong class="source-inline">while</strong> loop, which, because the condition is at the start of the loop, will execute zero or more times. In contrast, the <strong class="source-inline">do-while</strong> loop, where the condition is at the end of the loop, will execute one or more times. The <strong class="source-inline">while</strong> and <strong class="source-inline">do-while</strong> loops are very useful when you do not know how many times a loop <span class="No-Break">will iterate.</span></p>
			<p>In contrast, the traditional <strong class="source-inline">for</strong> loop is extremely useful when you do know how often you want a loop executed. The traditional <strong class="source-inline">for</strong> loop’s header consists of three parts: the initialization section, the boolean expression, and the increment/decrement section. Thus, we can iterate a discrete number of times. This makes the traditional <strong class="source-inline">for</strong> loop ideal for <span class="No-Break">processing arrays.</span></p>
			<p>The enhanced <strong class="source-inline">for</strong> (<strong class="source-inline">for-each</strong>) loop is even more suitable for processing arrays (and collections), provided you are not interested in the current loop iteration index. Being concise, succinct, and easy to write, it is a more elegant <span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">for</strong></span><span class="No-Break"> loop.</span></p>
			<p>In effect, if you need to loop a specific number of times, use the traditional <strong class="source-inline">for</strong> loop. If you need to process an array/collection from the beginning all the way through to the end, with no concern for the loop index, use the enhanced <span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">for</strong></span><span class="No-Break"> version.</span></p>
			<p>All loops can, of course, be nested, and we looked at one such example. We defined a label as a case-sensitive identifier followed by a colon that immediately precedes <span class="No-Break">a loop.</span></p>
			<p>Nested loops and labels prepared us for our discussion regarding the <strong class="source-inline">break</strong> and <strong class="source-inline">continue</strong> keywords. Where <strong class="source-inline">break</strong> can also be used in a <strong class="source-inline">switch</strong> statement, <strong class="source-inline">continue</strong> can only be used inside loops. There are labeled and non-labeled versions of both. Regarding <strong class="source-inline">break</strong>, the unlabeled version exits the current loop, whereas the labeled version exits the identified loop. With regard to <strong class="source-inline">continue</strong>, the unlabeled version continues with the next iteration of the current loop, whereas the labeled version continues with the next iteration of the <span class="No-Break">identified loop.</span></p>
			<p>That completes our discussion on iteration. In this chapter, we touched upon arrays. Moving on to our next chapter, <a href="B19793_06.xhtml#_idTextAnchor118"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 6</em></span></a>, we will cover arrays <span class="No-Break">in detail.</span></p>
