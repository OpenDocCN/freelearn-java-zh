<p>Spring 5 Design Patterns is for all Java developers who want to learn Spring for the enterprise application. Therefore, enterprise Java developers will find it particularly useful in the understanding of design patterns used by the Spring Framework and how it solves common design problems in the enterprise application, and they will fully appreciate the examples presented in this book. Before reading this book, readers should have basic knowledge of Core Java, JSP, Servlet, and XML.</p>
<p>Spring 5 Framework is newly launched by Pivotal with reactive programming. Spring 5 introduces many new features and enhancements from its previous version. We will discuss all this in the book. <em>Spring 5 Design Patterns</em> will give you in-depth insight about the Spring Framework.</p>
<p>The great part of today's Spring Framework is that all companies have already taken it as a primary framework for development of the enterprise application. For Spring, no external enterprise server is needed to start working with it.</p>
<p>The goals of writing this book are to discuss all design patterns used behind the Spring Framework and how they are implemented in the Spring Framework. Here, the author has also given you some best practices that must be used in the design and development of the application.</p>
<p>The book contains 12 chapters that cover everything from the basics to more complex design pattern such as reactive programming.</p>
<p>Spring 5 Design Patterns is divided into three sections. The first section introduces you to the essentials of the design patterns and the Spring Framework. The second section steps behind the front end and shows where Spring fits in the back end of an application. The third section expands on this by showing how to build web applications with Spring and introducing a new feature of the Spring 5 reactive programming. This part also shows how to handle concurrency in the enterprise application.</p>

<p><a href="18f63847-961b-45a2-bef0-30602dcabed3.xhtml">Chapter 1</a>, <em>Getting Started with the Spring Framework 5.0 and Design Patterns</em>, gives an overview of the Spring 5 Framework and all new features of the Spring 5 Framework, including some basic examples of DI and AOP. You’ll also get an overview of the great Spring portfolio.</p>
<p><a href="75fe3bc7-3b5a-4e07-9915-73a0fd8a8ef2.xhtml" target="_blank">Chapter 2</a>, <em>Overview of GOF Design Patterns - Core Design Patterns<span>,</span><span> </span></em>gives an overview of the Core Design Pattern of the GoF Design Patterns family, including some best practices for an application design. You'll also get an overview of the common problems solving with design patterns.</p>
<p><a href="bd05acbb-a42a-4070-9e01-54a8ce049e41.xhtml" target="_blank">Chapter 3</a>, <em>Consideration of the Structural and the Behavioural Patterns</em>, gives an overview of the Structural and Behavioural Design Pattern of the GoF Design Patterns family, including some best practices for an application design. You’ll also get an overview of the common problem solving with design patterns.</p>
<p><a href="fb30c4f8-9c4c-4705-b508-3782801e2a81.xhtml" target="_blank">Chapter 4</a>, <em>Wiring Beans using Dependency Injection Pattern</em>, explores dependency injection pattern and detail about the configuration of Spring in an application, showing you various ways of configurations in your application. This includes a configuration with XML, Annotation, Java, and Mix.</p>
<p><a href="d0375506-d940-4fe5-bc09-d1033eed2986.xhtml" target="_blank">Chapter 5</a>, <em>Understanding the Bean Life cycle and Used Patterns</em>, gives an overview of Spring Bean Life cycle managed by the Spring container, including an understanding of Spring containers and IoC.

This chapter also sets the stage for later chapters where you'll use AOP to provide declarative services such as transactions, security, and caching.</p>
<p><a href="81848842-717f-4e27-9204-ace0a6fdce6f.xhtml" target="_blank">Chapter 7</a>, <em>Accessing Database with Spring and JDBC Template Pattern</em>, explores how to access the data with Spring and JDBC; here, you’ll see how to use Spring's JDBC abstraction and JDBC Template to query relational databases in a way that is far simpler than native JDBC.</p>
<p><a href="ac8786f8-8cc8-40de-8e40-7eea5e5cdb35.xhtml" target="_blank">Chapter 8</a>, <em>Accessing Database with Spring ORM and Transactions Implementing Patterns</em>, shows how Spring integrates with the ORM Frameworks, such as Hibernate and other implementations of the Java Persistence API (JPA) with Spring Transaction Management. Also, this contains magic provided by Spring Data JPA for on-the-fly queries generation.</p>
<p><a href="5963c4eb-5602-4338-a69f-fb0d6655d165.xhtml" target="_blank">Chapter 9</a>, <em>Improving Performance of Application using Caching Patterns</em>, shows how to improve application performance by avoiding the database altogether if the data needed is readily available. So, I will show you how Spring provides support for caching data.</p>
<p><a href="ef5eac66-9b41-4959-8155-96f002137409.xhtml" target="_blank">Chapter 10</a>, <em>Implementing MVC Pattern in a Web Application using Spring</em>, gives a quick overview of developing a web application with the Spring MVC. You'll learn the MVC pattern, Front Controller pattern, Dispatcher Servlet with the basics of Spring MVC, a web framework built on the principles of the Spring Framework. You'll discover how to write controllers to handle web requests and see how to transparently bind request parameters and payload to your business objects while providing validation and error handling at the same time. This chapter also gives a brief introduction to view and view resolver in the Spring MVC.</p>
<p><a href="313a6506-6bc8-4785-a51b-1637f219bd00.xhtml" target="_blank">Chapter 11</a>, <em>Implementing Reactive Design Pattern</em>, explores the Reactive Programming Model, which is programming with asynchronous data streams. You'll see how the Reactive System is implemented in the Spring Web Module.</p>
<p><a href="0be830f9-b9e6-439f-9e6f-efdaf1d84986.xhtml" target="_blank">Chapter 12</a>, <em>Implementing Concurrency Patterns</em>, takes a closer look at concurrency when handling multiple connections inside a web server. As outlined in our architectural model, request handling is decoupled from application logic.</p>

<p class="NormalPACKT"><span>This book can be read without a computer or laptop at hand, in which case you need nothing more than the book itself. Although to follow the examples in the book, you need Java 8, which you can download from <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html">http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html</a>. You will also need your favorite IDE for the examples, but I have used the Software Spring Tool Suite; download the latest version of Spring Tool Suite (STS) from <a href="https://spring.io/tools/sts/all">https://spring.io/tools/sts/all</a> according to your system OS. The Java 8 and STS work on a variety of platforms--Windows, macOS, and Linux.</span></p>
