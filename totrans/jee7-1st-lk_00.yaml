- en: When we considered writing this book, the main objective was to present the
    new features of Java EE 7 platform. But while writing, we came to realize that
    it would be interesting to make a clear and concise presentation of the relevant
    specifications and how to implement them. This led us to imagine a project that
    will help present almost all the specifications affected by Java EE 7 and how
    to put them together in order to build a large-scale application.

- en: In short, this book does not aim to show how to implement the different aspects
    of each Java EE 7 specification or list the best practices. Rather, it positions
    itself similar to the yellow pages for a city that has been built recently. In
    other words, this book will help you discover the innovations introduced by Java
    EE 7 and give you ideas to build solid applications.
