- en: This book will cover all the important aspects (Big Ticket features) involved
    in developing JSF 2.2 applications. It provides clear instructions for getting
    the most out of JSF 2.2 and offers many exercises (more than 300 complete applications)
    to build impressive JSF-based web applications.

- en: We start off with a chapter about Expression Language (EL) and cover the most
    important aspects of EL 2.2 and EL 3.0\. We continue with a comprehensive dissertation
    about communication in JSF, followed by an exciting chapter about JSF 2.2 scopes.
    At this point, we bring into discussion most of the JSF artifacts and configurations.
    Further, we start a suite of very interesting topics, such as HTML5 and AJAX.
    After that we dissect the JSF view state concept and learn how to deal with this
    delicate JSF topic. Furthermore, we will discuss in detail about custom components
    and composite components. After this, we will talk about library contracts (themes)
    of JSF 2.2 resources. Finally, the last chapter will fortify your knowledge about
    JSF 2.2 Facelets.

    JSF*, represents a dissection of JSF mechanisms used for ensuring communication
    between JSF artifacts. Therefore, we will cover context parameters, request parameters,
    JSF 2.2 actions on GET requests (view actions), and more.'

    teaches you to distinguish between the bad and good practices of using JSF and
    CDI scopes. We will discuss JSF scopes versus CDI scopes, request, session, view
    scope (including the new JSF 2.2 view scope), application, conversation scope,
    JSF 2.2 flow scope in detail (Big Ticket feature), and more.'

    – Part 1"), *JSF Configurations Using XML Files and Annotations – Part 1*, depicts
    the JSF artifact''s configuration aspects in a learning-by-example fashion. Configuring
    JSF artifacts in the `faces-config.xml` file is pretty straightforward and boring,
    but if we take each artifact and exploit its potential in several use cases, then
    things become much more interesting.'

    as a continuation of the previous chapter. Here, we will discuss configuring resource
    handlers (JSF 2.2''s new `javax.faces.WEBAPP_RESOURCES_DIRECTORY` context parameter),
    configuring flash (JSF 2.2 `FlashFactory`, `FlashWrapper`, and flash system events),
    JSF 2.2 Window ID API, the injection mechanism (which, starting with JSF 2.2,
    is possible in most JSF artifacts), and more.'

    in `UIData`). Moreover, we will learn about table pagination, deleting/editing/updating
    table rows, filtering, and styling JSF tables.'

    AJAX after a validation error), AJAX and JSF 2.2 flow scope, how to customize
    AJAX script, and more. This is a classic chapter in almost any JSF book.'
