- en: In the previous chapter, we learned about monitoring, accessing the execution
    information and administering the configurations, using listeners, reporting the
    batch job problems, and understanding the Spring Batch Administration features.
    The Spring Batch job execution deals with huge data that changes time-to-time.
    This detailed processing consumes huge infrastructure. It is obvious to expect
    these jobs to perform efficiently and meet the scaling needs with the growing
    size of the organization's data.

    and executions. As the organization size is growing day-by-day, the data to be
    processed per batch job also gets increased accordingly. It is important to design
    and configure our batch jobs to meet these performance and scaling expectations.

    interacting in between, cannot be changed every time we see change in data load
    or performance issues. Spring Batch offers rich configuration infrastructure to
    be able to scale jobs without altering them, by just tuning the configuration
    information.

    the configured reader, processor, and writers for the tasklets and task execution,

    of chunks, Spring Batch allows us to process multiple steps and flows simultaneously
    with the help of parallel processing. This feature enables the independent steps
    to execute in parallel and ensures a faster processing.

- en: Remote chunking is the process in which the original step reads the data calls
    from remote process to process and writes or receives the processed data back
    to write on to the system. As the remote chunking deals with the data transmission
    to another system that is remotely located, we should also consider the cost in
    building this infrastructure versus the advantage we are getting in remote processing.
    The actual step (master) executes the read process, and the remote slaves (listeners)
    could be the JMS listeners that execute the process and write steps, or return
    the processed information to the master.

- en: While the remote chunking reads the data at master node and handles the processing
    to another remote system (slave), partitioning executes the entire process (reading,
    processing, and writing) in parallel, by having the multiple systems having the
    entire processing ability. Here, the master step takes care of understanding the
    job and handing over the task to multiple slaves, and slaves have to take care
    of the rest of the tasks (reading, processing, and writing). Essentially, the
    slaves constitute the steps that take care of the read, process, and write in
    their own world.

    not being there, as the slave system takes care of the read step as well.

- en: While the multithread model fits for the basic tuning of chunk processing, parallel
    processing lets us configure independent steps to execute in parallel. Remote
    chunking needs comparatively larger infrastructure and configuration but fits
    for distributed nodes processing. Partitioning helps quickly replicate the batch
    infrastructure and configure the entire process to execute in parallel nodes,
    with a single point of the repository acting as master.

    parallel processing, remote chunking, and partitioning techniques. We finished
    this chapter with an understanding of choosing the right strategy to scale the
    batch application with the available infrastructure.
