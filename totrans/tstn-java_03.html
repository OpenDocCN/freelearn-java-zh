			<h1 id="_idParaDest-54"><a id="_idTextAnchor063"/>The Maven Build Tool</h1>
			<p>Java programs are seldom just a single file. They can consist of just a few files or thousands of files. We have seen that you must compile Java source code files into bytecode. Having to do this for so many files makes the work quite tedious. This is where a build tool <span class="No-Break">is invaluable.</span></p>
			<p>In the previous chapter, the programs were all run from the folder we stored them in. As programs grow into multiple files, you manage them by categorizing them. The basic categories that date back to the early days of programming are input, process, and output. You can break down these categories into specific tasks that your program must perform. In Java, we call a category a <strong class="bold">package</strong>. A package, in<a id="_idIndexMarker203"/> turn, is a folder into which you store all the Java files that are part of the category. A complex program may consist of hundreds of files organized <span class="No-Break">into packages.</span></p>
			<p>In this environment, you must compile every single file. As you can imagine, this can be very tedious if you must compile them one at a time. One of the purposes of a build system is to simplify this task, and at the very minimum, all you must enter at the command line is <strong class="source-inline">mvn</strong>, the Maven executable program. In this chapter, we will see how we can use <strong class="bold">Maven</strong>. As Maven<a id="_idIndexMarker204"/> is a feature of every IDE, you can load any program organized as a Maven-managed project into <span class="No-Break">any IDE.</span></p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Important note</p>
			<p class="callout">While Maven is the most widely used build system, it is not the only one. Another popular build system is <a id="_idIndexMarker205"/>called <strong class="bold">Gradle</strong>. What sets it apart from Maven is that it uses an imperative rather than <a id="_idIndexMarker206"/>a declarative configuration file. Gradle uses a <strong class="bold">Domain-Specific Language</strong> (<strong class="bold">DSL</strong>) based on<a id="_idIndexMarker207"/> the <strong class="bold">Groovy</strong> language. As such, it could be used for general programming, although its vocabulary and syntax are designed for building software projects. </p>
			<p>In this chapter, we will cover <span class="No-Break">the following:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><span class="No-Break">Installing Maven</span></li>
				<li>Overview of <span class="No-Break">Maven functionality</span></li>
				<li>The <strong class="source-inline">pom.xml</strong> <span class="No-Break">configuration file</span></li>
				<li><span class="No-Break">Running Maven</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>By the end of this chapter, you will gain a sufficient understanding of the Maven build process to be able to use it right away. Later in the book, we will see how we can use Maven to manage testing. See the <em class="italic">Further reading</em> section for links to articles and free books that cover Maven in far more detail. </p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-55"><a id="_idTextAnchor064"/>Technical requirements</h1>
			<p>Here are the tools required to run the examples in <span class="No-Break">this chapter:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li>Java <span class="No-Break">17 installed</span></li>
				<li>A <span class="No-Break">text editor</span></li>
				<li>Maven 3.8.6 or a newer <span class="No-Break">version installed</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>I suggest downloading the source code that goes with this book from <a href="https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Transitioning-to-Java/tree/chapter03">https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Transitioning-to-Java/tree/chapter03</a> before you proceed so that you try out what is shown in <span class="No-Break">this chapter.</span></p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Note</p>
			<p class="callout">Ubuntu and other Linux distributions may have a version of Maven already installed. If it is not version 3.8.6 or greater, you must replace it with the <span class="No-Break">newest version.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-56"><a id="_idTextAnchor065"/>Installing Maven</h1>
			<p>Visit the<a id="_idIndexMarker208"/> Maven download page at <a href="https://maven.apache.org/download.html">https://maven.apache.org/download.html</a>. Here, you will find the program in two different compressed<a id="_idIndexMarker209"/> formats, one for Windows (<strong class="source-inline">.zip</strong>) and one for <span class="No-Break">Linux/macOS (</span><span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">tar.gz</strong></span><span class="No-Break">).</span></p>

			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 3.1 – Maven compressed files</p>
			<p>The versions<a id="_idIndexMarker210"/> shown here represent the current ones at the time of this writing. When starting out, it is best to install the most recent version. Now, let us review how we install Maven for <span class="No-Break">each OS.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-57"><a id="_idTextAnchor066"/>Windows</h2>
			<p>There is<a id="_idIndexMarker211"/> no installer for Maven. Unzip the ZIP archive into a folder. As we <a id="_idIndexMarker212"/>saw when we installed Java without an installer, I use a folder called <strong class="source-inline">devapp</strong> for all my development tools. Once unzipped, you need to add the location of the <strong class="source-inline">bin</strong> folder to your path. You may come across references to two environment variables, <strong class="source-inline">M2_HOME</strong> and <strong class="source-inline">MAVEN_HOME</strong>. While they don’t do any harm, both are obsolete as of <span class="No-Break">Maven 3.5.x.</span></p>
			<p>If you are an admin on your computer, then just add the path to the <strong class="source-inline">bin</strong> folder to your path. If you are not, then use the <strong class="source-inline">set</strong> command to add it to your path. Here is my <strong class="source-inline">setjava.bat</strong> file for non-admins. Change your batch file to match your <span class="No-Break">folder structure.</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
set JAVA_HOME=C:\devapp\jdk-17.0.2+8
set PATH=%JAVA_HOME%/bin;C:\devapp\apache-maven-3.8.6\bin;%PATH%</pre>
			<p>You can verify that Maven is working with <span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">mvn --version</strong></span><span class="No-Break">:</span></p>
			<div>

			<h2 id="_idParaDest-58"><a id="_idTextAnchor067"/>Linux</h2>
			<p>If <a id="_idIndexMarker213"/>you have<a id="_idIndexMarker214"/> superuser status, you can use <span class="No-Break">this command:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
$ sudo apt-get install maven</pre>
			<p>Verify it with <span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">mvn --version</strong></span><span class="No-Break">.</span></p>
			<p>If you are not a superuser, unzip the <strong class="source-inline">tar.gz</strong> file downloaded from the Maven website into the folder of your choice: </p>
			<pre class="source-code">
$ tar -xvf apache-maven-3.8.6-bin.tar.gz -C /usr/local/apache-maven/apache-maven-3.8.6</pre>
			<p>Now, add the location for Maven to <span class="No-Break">your path:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
export PATH=/usr/local/apache-maven/apache-maven-3.8.6/bin
:$PATH</pre>
			<p>Add this line to your <strong class="source-inline">.profile</strong> or <strong class="source-inline">.bash_profile</strong> file according to your <span class="No-Break">Linux distribution.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-59"><a id="_idTextAnchor068"/>macOS</h2>
			<p>Assuming <a id="_idIndexMarker215"/>that you are using Homebrew on your Mac, you can install <a id="_idIndexMarker216"/>Maven with <span class="No-Break">the following:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
$ brew install maven</pre>
			<p>Verify the installation with <span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">mvn --version</strong></span><span class="No-Break">.</span></p>
			<p>If you do not have Homebrew or are not the superuser, then you can install Maven the same way as you installed it for Linux for non-superusers. Newer versions of macOS use <strong class="source-inline">.zshenv</strong> rather than <strong class="source-inline">.profile</strong> for your <span class="No-Break">user script.</span></p>

			<p>With Maven installed, let us look at what it offers us. </p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-60"><a id="_idTextAnchor069"/>Overview of Maven functionality</h1>
			<p>The standard Java libraries<a id="_idIndexMarker217"/> that are part of the JDK is quite extensive. However, there are added libraries that supply functionality, such as connecting to a relational database, which you must download and then add to the project before running it. You can configure Maven to do this for you. No need to visit a library’s web page – download the file, place it in the proper folder, and let the Java compiler know it is available. </p>
			<p>As with most build tools, Maven is more than just a tool for <span class="No-Break">compiling programs.</span></p>
			<p>In today’s development environment, code does not go from the developer right into production if it compiles successfully. There has to be unit testing of methods and integration testing of the interactions between the various modules or classes in a program. You will use specialized servers for this work, and you can configure Maven to carry <span class="No-Break">this out.</span></p>
			<p>Let us review what else it <span class="No-Break">can do.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-61"><a id="_idTextAnchor070"/>Dependency management</h2>
			<p>While the Java language and its <a id="_idIndexMarker218"/>standard libraries can cover multiple<a id="_idIndexMarker219"/> use cases, they only cover a small subset of what programmers want to do. Frequently, added Java libraries that provide support for tasks, such as GUI programming with JavaFX; certain drivers, such as one for working with a range of databases, for sophisticated logging, or for enhanced data collections; and more, need<a id="_idIndexMarker220"/> to be part of your program. The problem is that these libraries must be in the <strong class="bold">Java classpath</strong>. A classpath<a id="_idIndexMarker221"/> is the list of files and folders holding Java libraries that must be accessible in your filesystem. Without a tool such as Maven, you must download every library you wish to use and update the Java <span class="No-Break">classpath manually.</span></p>
			<p>However, Maven allows you to list all the libraries you plan to use in a project’s configuration file called<a id="_idIndexMarker222"/> the <strong class="bold">Project Object Model</strong> (<strong class="bold">POM</strong>), with the file name <strong class="source-inline">pom.xml</strong>. Maven keeps a folder on your filesystem where it stores the required dependency library files. This folder is called a repository. By default, this folder is placed inside another folder called <strong class="source-inline">.m2</strong>, which, in turn, is stored in your home directory. You can change this to use any folder from your computer, although most programmers leave the default folder location as is. </p>
			<p>If a required dependency is not already in your local repository, then Maven will download it. A <a id="_idIndexMarker223"/>default central repository called Maven Central<a id="_idIndexMarker224"/> exists and can be found at <a href="https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/">https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/</a>. You<a id="_idIndexMarker225"/> can search for libraries and retrieve the entry necessary to add to your <strong class="source-inline">pom.xml</strong> file at <a href="https://search.maven.org/">https://search.maven.org/</a>. </p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-62"><a id="_idTextAnchor071"/>Maven plugins</h2>
			<p>The Maven program is not<a id="_idIndexMarker226"/> large; it relies on Java programs called plugins to conduct its <a id="_idIndexMarker227"/>tasks. For example, there are plugins to compile and package code, run tests, execute and deploy the code to a server, and more. The <strong class="source-inline">pom.xml</strong> file is where we list the plugins along with the dependencies. You can search for plugins as you did for dependencies <span class="No-Break">at MVNRepository.</span></p>
			<p>The Maven program uses a range of default plugins available to you without including them in the <strong class="source-inline">pom.xml</strong> file. Major builds of Maven use versions of the default plugins at the time the build was released. To ensure that you are using the most recent version of the plugins, I recommend listing every plugin that you will use in the <strong class="source-inline">pom.xml</strong> file. In general, always explicitly list the plugins you will use rather than allow Maven to use its built-in or implicit plugins. </p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-63"><a id="_idTextAnchor072"/>Maven project layout</h2>
			<p>To use<a id="_idIndexMarker228"/> Maven, it is necessary to organize the program’s folder into a specific<a id="_idIndexMarker229"/> layout. You can configure Maven to use a layout of your choice. What follows is the default layout. This will allow Maven to discover all the files and resources that are part of your project. Let us look at the folder structure for a <span class="No-Break">desktop application:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
Project Folder
    /src
        /main
            /java        
            /resources    
        /test
            /java        
            /resources    
    pom.xml file</pre>
			<p>You must create these folders and the <strong class="source-inline">pom.xml</strong> file before you start coding from the command line with an editor. Your IDE will create this structure if you indicate it is a Maven project when you create it. All IDEs will open a Maven project if it follows this folder layout. </p>
			<p>After you<a id="_idIndexMarker230"/> have successfully built the program, you will find a new folder<a id="_idIndexMarker231"/> called <strong class="source-inline">target</strong>. This is where Maven stores the compiled source code files and the final packaged file called the <strong class="source-inline">jar</strong> file. Here is the folder structure of <strong class="source-inline">target</strong>: </p>
			<pre class="source-code">
    /target
        /classes
        /generated-sources
        /generated-test-sources
        /maven-archiver
        /maven-status
        /test-classes
        project.jar file</pre>
			<p>Maven creates this folder when you build a project for the first time. Each build will replace any file in <strong class="source-inline">target</strong> with a newer version when you change the matching source code file. Never edit or change any files found in <strong class="source-inline">target</strong> because the next time you create a build, it will replace the files in <strong class="source-inline">target</strong> and any edits you made will be lost. </p>
			<p>You can also instruct Maven to clean a project, and this results in contents of <strong class="source-inline">target</strong> being deleted. If the <strong class="source-inline">pom.xml</strong> file is instructing Maven to package your program as an archive, such as a JAR file, then you find the JAR or whichever archive you are creating in the <span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">target</strong></span><span class="No-Break"> folder.</span></p>
			<p>If you do not work with an IDE, you may consider writing a batch file or shell script to create this folder structure. </p>
			<p>The next<a id="_idIndexMarker232"/> task is to create the <strong class="source-inline">pom.xml</strong> file with the required <a id="_idIndexMarker233"/>plugins listed – but before we do that, let us look at how we organize multiple source code files <span class="No-Break">using packages.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-64"><a id="_idTextAnchor073"/>Java source code packages</h2>
			<p>The Java <a id="_idIndexMarker234"/>languages encourages developers to organize their code <a id="_idIndexMarker235"/>based on functionality. This could be code to interact with a user, access records from a database, or perform business calculations. In this section, we will learn about packages and how to use them in a Maven project. We already know that you do not need a package. The first program, <strong class="source-inline">CompoundInterest</strong>, that we ran in the previous chapter, did not have any packages. This was handy when a project just consisted of a single file. Once a project encompasses multiple files, you will <span class="No-Break">use packages.</span></p>
			<p>As we are using Maven, the location of our packages must <span class="No-Break">be </span><span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">src/main/java</strong></span><span class="No-Break">:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
Project Folder
    /src
        /main
            /java        </pre>
			<p>The rules for naming packages are similar to the rules for identifiers, as well as any rules for naming folders in <span class="No-Break">your OS:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
com.kenfogel.business</pre>
			<p>The periods stand for a slash, either a forward or back slash depending on your operating system. This means that <strong class="source-inline">business</strong> is a folder in <strong class="source-inline">kenfogel</strong> and <strong class="source-inline">kenfogel</strong> is a folder in <strong class="source-inline">com</strong>. Using our Maven layout, it will look <span class="No-Break">as follows:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
Project Folder
    /src
        /main
            /java        
                /com
                    /kenfogel
                        /business</pre>
			<p>When we use packages, each file belonging to the package must have a statement as the first line of code that declares the name of the package. </p>
			<p>In the previous chapter, we used a version of the <strong class="source-inline">CompoundInterest</strong> program with two classes in one file because the <strong class="bold">Single-File-Source-Code</strong> feature cannot have more than one file, as its name implies. Unless <a id="_idIndexMarker236"/>you need to use the Single-File-Source-Code feature, you should create a file for each class in your program. The file name must be the same as the public class name in the file. </p>
			<p>Here is the class that holds <a id="_idIndexMarker237"/>the business process; notice that it begins with the package statement. In this first part, we are declaring what external library we will need and then declaring the <a id="_idIndexMarker238"/>class and the <span class="No-Break">class variables:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
package com.kenfogel.compoundinterest.business;
import java.text.NumberFormat;
public class CompoundInterestCalculator04 {
    private final double principal = 100.0;
    private final double annualInterestRate = 0.05;
    private final double compoundPerTimeUnit = 12.0;
    private final double time = 5.0; 
    private final NumberFormat currencyFormat;
    private final NumberFormat percentFormat;</pre>
			<p>Next up are the <a id="_idIndexMarker239"/>methods<a id="_idIndexMarker240"/> that contain <span class="No-Break">executable code:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
    public CompoundInterestCalculator04() {
        currencyFormat = 
            NumberFormat.getCurrencyInstance();
        percentFormat = NumberFormat.getPercentInstance();
        percentFormat.setMinimumFractionDigits(0);
        percentFormat.setMaximumFractionDigits(5);
    }
    public void perform() {
        var result = calculateCompoundInterest();
        System.out.printf(
        "If you deposit %s in a savings account " +
        "that pays %s annual interest compounded " +                   
        "monthly%nyou will have after %1.0f years " +
        "%s%n", 
                currencyFormat.format(principal),
                percentFormat.format(annualInterestRate),
                time, currencyFormat.format(result));
    }
    private double calculateCompoundInterest() {
        var result = principal * 
            Math.pow(1 + annualInterestRate / 
                compoundPerTimeUnit, 
                time * compoundPerTimeUnit);
        return result;
    }
}</pre>
			<p>Every Java <a id="_idIndexMarker241"/>program must have at least one class<a id="_idIndexMarker242"/> that has one method named <strong class="source-inline">main</strong>. Here is the class in which the <strong class="source-inline">main</strong> <span class="No-Break">method exists:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
package com.kenfogel.compoundinterest.app;
import com.kenfogel.compoundinterest04.business.
CompoundInterestCalculator04;
public class CompoundInterest04 {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        var banker = new CompoundInterestCalculator04();
        banker.perform();
    }
}</pre>
			<p>In both files, you <a id="_idIndexMarker243"/>will see an <strong class="source-inline">import</strong> statement. To access a class that is not in the same package, you must import it. This statement informs the compiler that code coming from a class in another package will be used. Let’s discuss both the <strong class="source-inline">import</strong> statements: </p>
			<ul>
				<li>The first import statement makes the <strong class="source-inline">NumberFormat</strong> class—that is part of the <strong class="source-inline">java.text</strong> package—available to the compiler. Note that packages that begin with <strong class="source-inline">java</strong> or <strong class="source-inline">javax</strong> are usually part of the <span class="No-Break">Java installation:</span><pre class="source-code">
import java.text.NumberFormat;</pre></li>
				<li>In the second import statement, by using <strong class="source-inline">CompoundInterest04.java</strong>, we are instantiating the <strong class="source-inline">CompoundInterestCalculator04</strong> class in the <strong class="source-inline">main</strong> method. This class file is not in the same package, so you must import it to <span class="No-Break">reference it:</span><pre class="source-code">
import com.kenfogel.compoundinterest.business.
                      CompoundInterestCalculator04;</pre></li>
			</ul>
			<p>Here is the folder <a id="_idIndexMarker244"/>structure of the <strong class="source-inline">CompoundInterest</strong> program<a id="_idIndexMarker245"/> that Maven expects to find on your <span class="No-Break">storage device:</span></p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer031" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B19088_03_04.jpg" alt="Figure 3.4 – Basic Maven file structure"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 3.4 – Basic Maven file structure</p>
			<p>Here, we are looking at the<a id="_idIndexMarker246"/> directory structure for the <a id="_idIndexMarker247"/>Maven-managed <strong class="source-inline">CompoundInterest</strong> program. The project is organized into packages that match <strong class="source-inline">import</strong> statements in your code. Here, you can see how the package names, such as <strong class="source-inline">com.kenfogel.compoundinterest</strong>, exist in your filesystem. We have one last part of a Maven project we must learn about and that is the <span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">pom.xml</strong></span><span class="No-Break"> file.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-65"><a id="_idTextAnchor074"/>The pom.xml configuration file</h1>
			<p>You must configure<a id="_idIndexMarker248"/> Maven with a declarative XML file. This file declares, in XML format, all the information necessary to build a project. It lists the required libraries here, along with the plugins needed to support Maven tasks. In this section, we will examine the <strong class="source-inline">pom.xml</strong> file that holds the Maven configuration to build the <strong class="source-inline">CompoundInterest</strong> program. </p>
			<p>Here are the first three tags that are used in every <strong class="source-inline">pom.xml</strong> file <span class="No-Break">by everyone:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt;
&lt;project xmlns="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0" 
    xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" 
    xsi:schemaLocation="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0 
    http://maven.apache.org/xsd/maven-4.0.0.xsd"&gt;
    &lt;modelVersion&gt;4.0.0&lt;/modelVersion&gt;</pre>
			<p>Let’s describe the parts of the code we just wrote: </p>
			<ul>
				<li>The first line that begins with <strong class="source-inline">&lt;?xml</strong> is the XML prolog. These are the default values and could be left out, as it <span class="No-Break">is optional.</span></li>
				<li>The root <strong class="source-inline">project</strong> tag defines the XML namespaces. It includes the location of the schema file that validates the <strong class="source-inline">pom.xml</strong> file. </li>
				<li><strong class="source-inline">modelVersion</strong> refers to the version that the <strong class="source-inline">pom.xml</strong> file conforms to. Since Maven 2, it has been <strong class="source-inline">4.0.0</strong>, and any other value will result in an error. </li>
			</ul>
			<p>Next up is how we identify a project; consider the following <span class="No-Break">code block:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
    &lt;groupId&gt;com.kenfogel&lt;/groupId&gt;
    &lt;artifactId&gt;compoundinterest&lt;/artifactId&gt;
    &lt;version&gt;0.1-SNAPSHOT&lt;/version&gt;</pre>
			<p>These three tags are commonly referred to as the project’s GAV, using the first letter of each tag – <strong class="source-inline">groupId</strong>, <strong class="source-inline">artifactId</strong>, and <strong class="source-inline">version</strong>. Taken together, these should be unique for every project you create. </p>
			<p><strong class="source-inline">groupId</strong> and <strong class="source-inline">artifactId</strong> also <a id="_idIndexMarker249"/>define a default package in your code. You do not need to have this package, but can have any package structure you think is appropriate. When a project, either your own or one downloaded for your project, is stored in your local repository, <strong class="source-inline">version</strong> becomes another folder. This allows you to have multiple versions of a project that differ by version number. Should you be developing a library for download by Maven, then the contents of the three tags become the identification for users to download <span class="No-Break">your work.</span></p>
			<p>You are free to use any names you want in <strong class="source-inline">groupId</strong> and <strong class="source-inline">artifactId</strong>. It must conform to the XML rules for a string. There is a convention that says that the combination of <strong class="source-inline">groupId</strong> and <strong class="source-inline">artifactId</strong> should conform to Java’s rules for naming packages. The name should be unique, especially if you plan to make it available through Maven Central. Therefore, programmers use their company or personal domain name in reverse. If you do not have a domain, then simply use your name as I have. I do own <a href="http://kenfogel.com">kenfogel.com</a> and I recommend that all developers get a domain name for <span class="No-Break">their work.</span></p>
			<p>For <strong class="source-inline">version</strong>,  we are also free to use anything – numbers or strings. If you have previously downloaded a specific version of a library, then Maven will use the local copy. One special word, <strong class="source-inline">SNAPSHOT</strong>, when added to the end of the version designation, implies that this project is still in development. This means that Maven will download this library even if it exists in the local repository. Unless you reconfigure Maven, <strong class="source-inline">SNAPSHOT</strong> versions are only updated once <span class="No-Break">a day.</span></p>
			<p>Here is what Maven stores in your local repository after using Maven to run the project. You can see how it is stored using the <span class="No-Break">complete GAV:</span></p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer032" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B19088_03_05.jpg" alt="Figure 3.5 – The .m2/repository "/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 3.5 – The .m2/repository </p>
			<p>The folders other <a id="_idIndexMarker250"/>than <strong class="source-inline">compoundinterest</strong> have dependencies and plugins that the Maven program and your project require. </p>
			<p>Coming up, we will see a section of the <strong class="source-inline">pom.xml</strong> file called <strong class="source-inline">defaultGoals</strong> – a part of the <strong class="source-inline">build</strong> section of the <strong class="source-inline">pom.xml</strong> file. This is where you provide Maven with the tasks it must carry out. Maven does not place your project in your local repository unless you use <strong class="source-inline">install</strong> as one of your goals, and that is how this directory structure was created. The <strong class="source-inline">groupId</strong> element in the <strong class="source-inline">pom.xml</strong> file is broken down into folders based on the periods you placed in the tag. While <strong class="source-inline">artifactId</strong> and <strong class="source-inline">version</strong> in the <strong class="source-inline">pom.xml</strong> file may have periods in their text, they are not broken down into folders <span class="No-Break">like </span><span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">groupId</strong></span><span class="No-Break">.</span></p>
			<p>Next up is how we describe the final file that will contain everything necessary for your code to run. This is called <strong class="source-inline">package</strong> and refers to the various archive formats that Java programs can be <span class="No-Break">stored in:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
    &lt;packaging&gt;jar&lt;/packaging&gt;</pre>
			<p>If you do not <a id="_idIndexMarker251"/>have a <strong class="source-inline">&lt;packaging&gt;</strong> tag, then Maven will default to <strong class="source-inline">jar</strong>. These packages are compressed ZIP files with a folder structure and files required for the project. You can inspect any of these packaging formats by using any <strong class="source-inline">.zip</strong> utility. The choices for packaging are <span class="No-Break">as follows:</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-66"><a id="_idTextAnchor075"/>jar – Java archive</h2>
			<p><strong class="bold">Java archive</strong> is the basic<a id="_idIndexMarker252"/> ZIP archive file usually used for desktop applications. It is also usable for cloud-ready microservices. It contains a <strong class="source-inline">META-INF</strong> folder that has a file named <strong class="source-inline">MANIFEST.MF</strong>. If Maven has configured <strong class="source-inline">MANIFEST.MF</strong> to include the package and file name of the class that holds the <strong class="source-inline">main</strong> method, then you can run this file by double-clicking on it or entering the file name at the command prompt. </p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-67"><a id="_idTextAnchor076"/>war – web archive</h2>
			<p>This ZIP archive is for use on a <a id="_idIndexMarker253"/>web server such as <strong class="bold">Tomcat</strong>. Tomcat<a id="_idIndexMarker254"/> is a widely used open source Java web server that supports the web profile. The file organization of the <strong class="source-inline">.war</strong> file differs from a <strong class="source-inline">.jar</strong> file to meet the requirements of a web server, such as folders for HTML and <span class="No-Break">JavaScript files.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-68"><a id="_idTextAnchor077"/>ear – enterprise archive</h2>
			<p>This ZIP archive is for use on a<a id="_idIndexMarker255"/> Java enterprise profile servers such as Glassfish or WildFly. These are also called application servers that provide the functionality for running complex web applications. Modern web programming in Java recommends using <strong class="source-inline">.war</strong> files even for complex systems. I will discuss these in more detail when we look at web programming in <a href="B19088_14.xhtml#_idTextAnchor281"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 14</em></span></a>, <em class="italic">Server-Side Coding </em><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">with Jakarta</em></span><span class="No-Break">.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-69"><a id="_idTextAnchor078"/>pom – POM</h2>
			<p>Maven supports<a id="_idIndexMarker256"/> using multiple POM files. One way to do this is to have a parent POM file included as part of the project’s POM file. I have hundreds of projects that I have created for my students. Early on, I found myself editing each POM file in each project to update versions or add new dependencies and plugins that every project will share. Using a parent POM file, I can place all the common components in this file and then include them in the individual POM files of each project. If the project and parent POM files each have the same tag, then the project POM overrides the <span class="No-Break">parent POM.</span></p>
			<p>Let us continue going through the <span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">pom.xml</strong></span><span class="No-Break"> file:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
    &lt;description&gt;    
        First example of a Maven multi source code project 
    &lt;/description&gt;
    &lt;developers&gt;
        &lt;developer&gt;
            &lt;id&gt;&lt;/id&gt;
            &lt;name&gt;&lt;/name&gt;
            &lt;email&gt;&lt;/email&gt;
        &lt;/developer&gt;
    &lt;/developers&gt;
    &lt;organization&gt;
        &lt;name&gt;&lt;/name&gt;
    &lt;/organization&gt;</pre>
			<p>These are three optional sections that provide additional information that can help manage <span class="No-Break">the project:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="source-inline">&lt;description&gt; </strong><ul><li>Brief description of the project <span class="No-Break">in sentences</span></li></ul></li>
				<li>&lt;<span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">developers&gt;</strong></span><ul><li>Here you can list the team members. I have used it to identify my students. </li></ul></li>
				<li><strong class="source-inline">&lt;</strong><span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">organization&gt;</strong></span><ul><li>Name of the company you work for or the name of the client </li></ul></li>
			</ul>
			<p>The <strong class="source-inline">archive</strong> file, the packaging that is created, holds all the compiled bytecode and any required libraries. It also includes the <strong class="source-inline">pom.xml</strong> file. This makes it possible for web and enterprise servers <a id="_idIndexMarker257"/>to display this information in the web console or dashboard. </p>
			<p>Next up is the properties section of the file; consider the following <span class="No-Break">code block:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
&lt;properties&gt;
    &lt;java.version&gt;17&lt;/java.version&gt;
    &lt;project.build.sourceEncoding&gt;
        UTF-8
    &lt;/project.build.sourceEncoding&gt;
    &lt;maven.compiler.release&gt;
        ${java.version}
    &lt;/maven.compiler.source&gt;
    &lt;exec.mainClass&gt;
        com.kenfogel.compoundinterest.app.CompoundInterest04
    &lt;/exec.mainClass&gt;
&lt;/properties&gt;</pre>
			<p>In the preceding <a id="_idIndexMarker258"/>code block, think of <strong class="source-inline">properties</strong> as variables that you can use elsewhere in the POM file, such as defining the Java version the compiler will come from or the name of the class containing the <strong class="source-inline">main</strong> method when creating a <strong class="source-inline">MANIFEST.MF</strong> file. You can see that <strong class="source-inline">java.version</strong> becomes <strong class="source-inline">${java.version}</strong>. You can now use this value elsewhere in the POM file. The Maven plugin that manages compilation will use the compiler source and target source. <strong class="source-inline">exec.mainClass</strong> denotes the class that holds the <span class="No-Break">main method.</span></p>
			<p>Next up are dependencies; these are external libraries that your program requires. Consider the following code block: </p>
			<pre class="source-code">
    &lt;dependencies&gt;
        &lt;dependency&gt;
            &lt;groupId&gt;org.openjfx&lt;/groupId&gt;
            &lt;artifactId&gt;javafx-controls&lt;/artifactId&gt;
            &lt;version&gt;18.0.1&lt;/version&gt;
            &lt;scope&gt;compile&lt;/scope&gt;
        &lt;/dependency&gt;
        &lt;dependency&gt;
            &lt;groupId&gt;mysql&lt;/groupId&gt;
            &lt;artifactId&gt;mysql-connector-java&lt;/artifactId&gt;
            &lt;version&gt;8.0.29&lt;/version&gt;
            &lt;scope&gt;runtime&lt;/scope&gt;
        &lt;/dependency&gt;
        &lt;dependency&gt;
            &lt;groupId&gt;org.junit.jupiter&lt;/groupId&gt;
            &lt;artifactId&gt;junit-jupiter-engine&lt;/artifactId&gt;
            &lt;version&gt;5.8.2&lt;/version&gt;
            &lt;scope&gt;test&lt;/scope&gt;
        &lt;/dependency&gt;      
    &lt;/dependencies&gt;</pre>
			<p>A dependency<a id="_idIndexMarker259"/> is a library that must be available for the program to compile and execute. If a dependency is not found in your local repository, then Maven will download it. </p>
			<p>Just as you named your project, the first three tags, <strong class="source-inline">groupId</strong>, <strong class="source-inline">artifactId</strong>, and <strong class="source-inline">version</strong>, name the library you wish to use. Maven uses this information to identify what it must look for in your local repository or a remote repository so it can be downloaded. </p>
			<p>A new tag appears here called <strong class="source-inline">&lt;scope&gt;</strong>. Here are the four most <span class="No-Break">used scopes:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Compile scope</strong>: This is<a id="_idIndexMarker260"/> the default scope. It means that this library is required to<a id="_idIndexMarker261"/> compile the program. It will also be added to the package. </li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Runtime scope</strong>: This<a id="_idIndexMarker262"/> library must be available at runtime, but <a id="_idIndexMarker263"/>it is not used for <a id="_idIndexMarker264"/>compiling. <strong class="bold">Java Database Connectivity</strong> drivers fall into this category, as Java only uses them when the <span class="No-Break">program runs.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Provided scope</strong>: When you<a id="_idIndexMarker265"/> run a program in a framework such as Spring or an application server such as WildFly, many of the project’s<a id="_idIndexMarker266"/> dependency libraries are included in the server. This means you do not need to add them to the archive. You will need these files to compile the code, and Maven will download them into your repository so that the compiler can verify that you are using them correctly. </li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Test scope</strong>: Unit testing <a id="_idIndexMarker267"/>involves the writing of test classes. These test classes <a id="_idIndexMarker268"/>are compiled and stored in the <strong class="source-inline">test</strong> branch of the Maven project and not the <strong class="source-inline">java</strong> branch. </li>
			</ul>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-70"><a id="_idTextAnchor079"/>The build section</h2>
			<p>Next up is the <strong class="source-inline">build</strong> section, where we <a id="_idIndexMarker269"/>define what tasks we want Maven to carry out and what we will need to accomplish. In Maven, you can express the tasks you want to carry out as either a lifecycle, a phase, or a goal. A lifecycle consists of multiple phases, a phase can consist of multiple goals, and a goal is a specific task. </p>
			<p>In Maven, there are just three lifecycles, whereas there are numerous phases and goals: </p>
			<pre class="source-code">
    &lt;build&gt;
        &lt;defaultGoal&gt;clean package exec:java&lt;/defaultGoal&gt;</pre>
			<p>Here we have the <strong class="source-inline">defaultGoal</strong> tag of the <strong class="source-inline">build</strong> section of a POM file. If you do not use this tag, then Maven will use the <strong class="source-inline">Default</strong> lifecycle, which, in turn, invokes 21 phases. In this example, we are explicitly invoking two phases and <span class="No-Break">one goal.</span></p>
			<p>As the name of this tag implies, this is the set of phases and goals that will be performed in case no goals or phases were otherwise defined (via the command line). The <strong class="source-inline">clean</strong> belongs to the <strong class="source-inline">Clean</strong> lifecycle, which, in turn, consists of three phases. When we list a phase such as <strong class="source-inline">clean</strong>, Maven will also carry out every phase that precedes it. In the case of the <strong class="source-inline">Clean</strong> lifecycle, if you show the <strong class="source-inline">clean</strong> phase, then it also carries out the <strong class="source-inline">pre-clean</strong> phase but not the <strong class="source-inline">post-clean</strong> phase. To carry out all the operations of a lifecycle, you simply use the last phase of <span class="No-Break">the lifecycle.</span></p>
			<p>In this example, we see two<a id="_idIndexMarker270"/> phases and one goal. We just saw that the <strong class="source-inline">clean</strong> phase invokes its preceding phase first. The package phase is preceded by 16 phases, each of which will be carried out. A goal is a single task and does not invoke anything else. The <strong class="source-inline">exec:java</strong> goal is used to execute your code explicitly after all previous phases and goals complete successfully. </p>
			<p>Here are a handful of the phases and goals we will <span class="No-Break">be using.</span></p>
			<h3>Phases</h3>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="source-inline">clean</strong>: Deletes the target <a id="_idIndexMarker271"/>folder. This will force Maven to compile all the source files. If not used, only source code files with a date and time later than the corresponding <strong class="source-inline">.class</strong> file are compiled. This goal is a member of the <strong class="source-inline">Clean</strong> lifecycle and does not invoke any other goals in <span class="No-Break">other lifecycles.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="source-inline">compile</strong>: <strong class="source-inline">compile</strong> will go through the source code tree, compile every source code file, and write the bytecode to the target folder. As a member of the <strong class="source-inline">Default</strong> lifecycle, and before Maven runs <strong class="source-inline">compile</strong>, it will first perform all the goals that <span class="No-Break">precede it.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="source-inline">test</strong>: This goal will invoke the unit tests. As the subsequent goals will run tests, we do not have to list them explicitly. However, if you just want to compile and test your code, then you can use <strong class="source-inline">test</strong> as the <span class="No-Break">final goal.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="source-inline">package</strong>: This combines all the files into a <strong class="source-inline">jar</strong> package assuming that the <strong class="source-inline">&lt;packaging&gt;</strong> tag in the POM file is <strong class="source-inline">jar</strong>. The test goal precedes the package in the <strong class="source-inline">Default</strong> lifecycle. Therefore, Maven will run the unit tests, if there are <span class="No-Break">any, first.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="source-inline">install</strong>: This adds this project to your local repository if all previous goals have been <span class="No-Break">completed</span><span class="No-Break"><a id="_idIndexMarker272"/></span><span class="No-Break"> successfully.</span></li>
			</ul>
			<h3>Goals</h3>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="source-inline">exec:java</strong> and <strong class="source-inline">exec:exec</strong>: These <a id="_idIndexMarker273"/>two are not part of the standard lifecycles. They require a special plugin and do not execute any other goals. <strong class="source-inline">exec:java</strong> will use the same JVM that Maven is running in. <strong class="source-inline">exec:exec</strong> will spawn or start up a new JVM. This can be useful if you need to configure <span class="No-Break">the JVM.</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>You can override the <strong class="source-inline">defaultGoal</strong> tag by placing a phase name on the command line <span class="No-Break">as follows:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
mvn package</pre>
			<p>In this example, as the package belongs to the <strong class="source-inline">Default</strong> lifecycle, all phases that precede it will be carried out first. All the phases and goals in <strong class="source-inline">defaultGoal</strong> <span class="No-Break">are ignored.</span></p>
			<h3>Plugins</h3>
			<p>Here is the concluding section of the<a id="_idIndexMarker274"/> build, where we will define the plugins. Except for <strong class="source-inline">maven-clean-plugin</strong> and <strong class="source-inline">exec-maven-plugin</strong>, all of these plugins exist in Maven as defaults. The versions of the plugins are decided when a major revision occurs, such as going from Maven 2 to Maven 3. This list is not updated with point releases. </p>
			<p>Maven 3, introduced in 2010, has an internal list of default plugins that is quite old. For that reason, you should declare every plugin you will use, even if there is a default; that is what you <span class="No-Break">see here.</span></p>
			<p>Some plugins have tags that allow you to configure how they carry out their task. <strong class="source-inline">maven-jar-plugin</strong> allows you to show the class that holds the main method in its <strong class="source-inline">&lt;mainClass&gt;</strong> tag. We will configure the <strong class="source-inline">surefire</strong> plugin when we examine unit testing to turn unit tests on or off. As we look at different programs, we will be enhancing this and other POM files we <span class="No-Break">will use:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li>This plugin <a id="_idIndexMarker275"/>is responsible for deleting any output from a previous run <span class="No-Break">of Maven:</span><pre class="source-code">
        &lt;plugin&gt;
            &lt;groupId&gt;org.apache.maven.plugins&lt;/groupId&gt;
            &lt;artifactId&gt;maven-clean-plugin&lt;/artifactId&gt;
            &lt;version&gt;3.2.0&lt;/version&gt;
        &lt;/plugin&gt;</pre></li>
				<li>This plugin includes any files in the resource folder of a project into the final packaging; a resource can be an image or a <span class="No-Break">properties file:</span><pre class="source-code">
        &lt;plugin&gt;
            &lt;groupId&gt;org.apache.maven.plugins&lt;/groupId&gt;
            &lt;artifactId&gt;  
                maven-resources-plugin
            &lt;/artifactId&gt;
            &lt;version&gt;3.2.0&lt;/version&gt;
        &lt;/plugin&gt;</pre></li>
				<li>This is the plugin that invokes the <span class="No-Break">Java compiler:</span><pre class="source-code">
        &lt;plugin&gt;
            &lt;groupId&gt;org.apache.maven.plugins&lt;/groupId&gt;
            &lt;artifactId&gt;
                maven-compiler-plugin
            &lt;/artifactId&gt;
            &lt;version&gt;3.10.1&lt;/version&gt;
        &lt;/plugin&gt;</pre></li>
				<li>If you are performing unit tests, this plugin is used to configure the tests, such as to write the test results to <span class="No-Break">a file:</span><pre class="source-code">
        &lt;plugin&gt;
            &lt;groupId&gt;org.apache.maven.plugins&lt;/groupId&gt;
            &lt;artifactId&gt;
                maven-surefire-plugin
            &lt;/artifactId&gt;
            &lt;version&gt;2.22.2&lt;/version&gt;
        &lt;/plugin&gt;</pre></li>
				<li>This is the<a id="_idIndexMarker276"/> plugin responsible for packaging your program into a <strong class="source-inline">jar</strong> file. It includes the configuration to make the <strong class="source-inline">jar</strong> file executable by just double-clicking <span class="No-Break">on it:</span><pre class="source-code">
        &lt;plugin&gt;
            &lt;groupId&gt;org.apache.maven.plugins&lt;/groupId&gt;
            &lt;artifactId&gt;maven-jar-plugin&lt;/artifactId&gt;
            &lt;version&gt;3.2.2&lt;/version&gt;    
            &lt;configuration&gt;
                &lt;archive&gt;
                    &lt;manifest&gt;
                        &lt;mainClass&gt;
                            ${exec.mainClass}
                        &lt;/mainClass&gt;
                    &lt;/manifest&gt;
                &lt;/archive&gt;
             &lt;/configuration&gt;
        &lt;/plugin&gt;</pre></li>
				<li>This plugin allows Maven to execute <span class="No-Break">your program:</span><pre class="source-code">
        &lt;plugin&gt;
            &lt;groupId&gt;org.codehaus.mojo&lt;/groupId&gt;
            &lt;artifactId&gt;exec-maven-plugin&lt;/artifactId&gt;
            &lt;version&gt;3.0.0&lt;/version&gt;
        &lt;/plugin&gt;
    &lt;/plugins&gt;
&lt;/build&gt;</pre></li>
				<li>We close <a id="_idIndexMarker277"/>the root tag: <pre class="source-code">
&lt;/project&gt;</pre></li>
			</ul>
			<p>With our POM file ready, we are now ready to <span class="No-Break">use Maven.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-71"><a id="_idTextAnchor080"/>Running Maven</h1>
			<p>Once you have set up the Maven<a id="_idIndexMarker278"/> file structure, written your <strong class="source-inline">pom.xml</strong> file, coded your sources, and added any resources, such as images, then all you need to do is use Maven, which is <span class="No-Break">quite straightforward.</span></p>
			<p>Let us begin by running Maven on the <span class="No-Break">command line.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-72"><a id="_idTextAnchor081"/>Command-line Maven</h2>
			<p>Here are the steps<a id="_idIndexMarker279"/> to follow<a id="_idIndexMarker280"/> to use Maven on the <span class="No-Break">command line:</span></p>
			<ol>
				<li>Open a terminal or console in the folder that holds the project’s folders, such <span class="No-Break">as </span><span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">src</strong></span><span class="No-Break">.</span></li>
				<li>Configure your setup if needed, should you not be an admin <span class="No-Break">or superuser.</span></li>
				<li>Enter the <strong class="source-inline">mvn</strong> command at the prompt. If there are no errors in your code, it should conduct all the goals you asked for. If there are errors, then you need to review the output of Maven, correct the errors, and use <strong class="source-inline">mvn</strong> again. </li>
			</ol>
			<p>Here is my output from a <span class="No-Break">successful build:</span></p>

			<p>You can also <a id="_idIndexMarker285"/>request more information on failures by running <a id="_idIndexMarker286"/>Maven as <strong class="source-inline">mvn -X</strong>.

			<h2 id="_idParaDest-73"><a id="_idTextAnchor082"/>Running Maven in an IDE</h2>
			<p>Maven is normally included in <a id="_idIndexMarker287"/>IDE distributions. If you do not plan to work from the<a id="_idIndexMarker288"/> command line, you do not need to download and install Maven unless your IDE requests. </p>
			<p>All IDEs have a <strong class="source-inline">run</strong> command and/or a <strong class="source-inline">run maven</strong> command. If both exist, use <strong class="source-inline">run maven</strong>. If there is no <strong class="source-inline">run maven</strong> command, expect the <strong class="source-inline">run</strong> command to recognize that this is a Maven project and use Maven rather than its internal build system to process your program. </p>
			<p>An IDE will highlight <a id="_idIndexMarker289"/>errors in your source code and <strong class="source-inline">pom.xml</strong> file before you run<a id="_idIndexMarker290"/> the project. When the IDE recognizes errors, it will not compile your code until the issues <span class="No-Break">are resolved.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-74"><a id="_idTextAnchor083"/>Summary</h1>
			<p>In this chapter, we have learned how to use Maven, the most widely used Java build tool. The heart of Maven is the <strong class="source-inline">pom.xml</strong> file; we have seen the most significant sections of this file and what they are used for. Going forward, all the examples will be Maven-based. </p>
			<p>By now, you know how to organize the directories for a Maven project, the components of a basic <strong class="source-inline">pom.xml</strong> file, and how to invoke Maven to build and execute <span class="No-Break">your program.</span></p>
			<p>Next, we will examine the object-oriented structure of a Java program, what an object is, and the coding syntax for loops <span class="No-Break">and decisions.</span></p>
