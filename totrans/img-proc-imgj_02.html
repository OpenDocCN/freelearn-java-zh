This chapter will deal with the following topics:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Supported image types in ImageJ</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Multidimensional images</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Loading and saving images</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Viewing and obtaining pixel values</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Calibrating images for measurements</li></ul></div><div class="section" title="Images in ImageJ"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl1sec16"/>Images in ImageJ</h1></div></div></div><p>ImageJ has a <a id="id33" class="indexterm"/>wide support for multiple common image formats such as JPEG, PNG, and TIFF. With the help of the <span class="strong"><strong>Bio-Formats</strong></span> plugin, a wide range of proprietary image <a id="id34" class="indexterm"/>formats can also be loaded (for example, STK files [Metamorph], and LSM files [Zeiss]) as well as certain medical image formats (<span class="strong"><strong>Dicom</strong></span>) and astronomy formats (<span class="strong"><strong>FITS</strong></span>). The most recent version of Fiji comes with the Bio-Formats plugin and <a id="id35" class="indexterm"/>supports the files of almost all the major image formats.</p><p>This chapter will use some of the image files that are available from the sample images item in the <span class="strong"><strong>File</strong></span> menu. These files are accessible from the Internet, so they require a functional Internet connection. The whole suite of images is also available as a single download from the ImageJ website. When using the Fiji distribution, the image set can be cached locally by going to <span class="strong"><strong>File</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Open Samples</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Cache Sample Images</strong></span> from the menu.</p><p>We will start by opening one of these sample images to demonstrate some of the features in ImageJ regarding images. To do so, start ImageJ as described in the previous chapter. Go to <span class="strong"><strong>File</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Open Samples</strong></span>, and select <span class="strong"><strong>Boats (356K)</strong></span>. This image is taken from <a class="ulink" href="http://imagej.nih.gov/ij/images/boats.gif">http://imagej.nih.gov/ij/images/boats.gif</a>, and shows a picture of some boats in the harbor. The <a id="id36" class="indexterm"/>same image can also be loaded by going to <span class="strong"><strong>Import</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>URL</strong></span> in the <span class="strong"><strong>File</strong></span> menu and copying the earlier URL and pasting it in the field. The image should load and display in a new window as follows:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/Insert_image_B04909_02_01.jpg" alt="Images in ImageJ"/></div><p>The title bar shows the filename (<span class="strong"><strong>boats.gif</strong></span>). Just below the title bar is an information strip that shows the key <a id="id37" class="indexterm"/>parameters of the image: the size of the image (<span class="strong"><strong>720x576 pixels</strong></span>), the <a id="id38" class="indexterm"/>image type (<span class="strong"><strong>8 bit</strong></span>) and the file size (<span class="strong"><strong>405K</strong></span>). The upcoming sections will provide more details on the basics of image types in ImageJ.</p><div class="section" title="Image types"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl2sec16"/>Image types</h2></div></div></div><p>An image is built up using <a id="id39" class="indexterm"/>pixels, where each pixel has a value that is encoded by bits. The number of bits determines the number of gray values or colors that can be represented. The upcoming sections will briefly explain the different image types that are supported by ImageJ.</p><div class="section" title="Grayscale images"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl3sec01"/>Grayscale images</h3></div></div></div><p>The boats image <a id="id40" class="indexterm"/>from the previous section was an 8-bit grayscale image, which means each pixel has a value between 0 (black) and 255 (white). Grayscale images can also be 16 bit (values between 0 and 65535) and 32 bit (floating-point images). The <a id="id41" class="indexterm"/>gray values of an image are represented in the <span class="strong"><strong>lookup table</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong>LUT</strong></span>). For 8-bit images, the LUT maps a value between 0 and 255 to an equal mix of red, green, and blue on your computer screen to display the gray level. For instance, a <a id="id42" class="indexterm"/>mid-gray level of 128 will be displayed on your screen as RGB value (128,128,128). It is also possible to change the mapping of the LUT to different scales for display. By changing the LUT, you can change the color appearance of the image on the screen. If you would like to give the grayscale image a green appearance, you can <a id="id43" class="indexterm"/>set the LUT to green. This will tell ImageJ to map the mid-gray value on your screen to the RGB value (0,128,0), thus appearing darker green. The same principles hold for 16-bit and 32-bit images, although they have more levels of gray that they can represent. These distinctions become important when creating macros and plugins, as certain processing steps can only be performed on 8-bit images.</p></div><div class="section" title="Color images"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl3sec02"/>Color images</h3></div></div></div><p>Color images have generally <a id="id44" class="indexterm"/>two bit depths: <span class="strong"><strong>8-bit</strong></span> and <span class="strong"><strong>24-bit</strong></span> color. The 8-bit color image type is an indexed image, where the index determines the color of the image. An <a id="id45" class="indexterm"/>example of an 8-bit color image is the GIF file format. It stores up to 256 colors in its index, which results in smaller file sizes at the cost of a reduced number of colors. These images store a table of 256 red, green, and blue (RGB) values (also called the palette). Each entry in the table has an index that is referenced in the image for the pixels that use that specific color. This type is rare nowadays, as the reduced file size is no longer that critical due to larger storage capacity and faster Internet connections. By going to <span class="strong"><strong>Image</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Color</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Show LUT</strong></span> from the ImageJ menu, you can view the palette or a list of indices from an indexed image.</p><p>RGB images such as JPG or PNG files are color images with 24 bits of information: 8 bits each for the red, green, and blue channel. PNG files can have an additional 8 bits for the transparency channel. Besides RGB images, it is also possible to generate images using different color spaces such as <span class="strong"><strong>L*a*b</strong></span> and <a id="id46" class="indexterm"/>
<span class="strong"><strong>HSB</strong></span>. HSB images split the three components of a RGB image into hue, saturation, and brightness channels. The hue component can be compared to the color (blue, green, violet, and so on) of a pixel. Small hue values are used for red and orange, whereas medium values will represent cyan and blue. High hue values represent magenta and red. In this image, you can see the mapping of the hue channel to colors in an RGB image (the S and B channels were kept white):</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/Insert_image_B04909_02_08.jpg" alt="Color images"/></div><p>Note that the mapping of the hue channel is circular. Both pure white and pure black have the same color. They start at red and end at red.</p><p>Modifying the saturation makes the colors more or less <span class="emphasis"><em>colored</em></span>. A small saturation value will make the colors look <a id="id47" class="indexterm"/>more gray, while a high saturation value will make the colors more pure. The following example shows a horizontal gradient for the hue channel and a vertical gradient for the saturation channel (the brightness channel was constant; the orange box delineates the different channels):</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/Insert_image_B04909_02_09.jpg" alt="Color images"/></div><p>As you move from the bottom of the lower panel to the top, the colors get more washed out, becoming less vibrant and, in this case, becoming white. The color of the upper part is determined by the brightness channel, which was white in this example.</p><p>Changing the brightness value makes the colors brighter or darker. High values leave the colors intact and bright, while low values make the colors appear more like black. The following image shows this effect, where the horizontal gradient is again the hue channel, while the vertical gradient is the brightness channel (the saturation channel was uniform white):</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/Insert_image_B04909_02_10.jpg" alt="Color images"/></div><p>A real image will have combinations of gray values for hue, saturation, and brightness, which together result in the final color.</p><div class="note" title="Note" style=""><div class="inner"><h3 class="title"><a id="note02"/>Note</h3><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Converting between image types</strong></span>
</p><p>It is possible to <a id="id48" class="indexterm"/>change a 16-bit image to an 8-bit image at the cost of losing pixel intensity information. To do so, go to <span class="strong"><strong>Image</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Type</strong></span> and select the image type you wish to convert to. However, not every conversion is possible. For example, an RGB image cannot be converted to an 8-bit grayscale image (directly)!</p></div></div></div></div><div class="section" title="Stacks and hyperstacks"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl2sec17"/>Stacks and hyperstacks</h2></div></div></div><p>The image types <a id="id49" class="indexterm"/>described in the previous sections were the basic image types that are supported by most graphical programs. However, ImageJ supports a different class of <a id="id50" class="indexterm"/>images that consists of multiple primitive image types combined into a single object: a <span class="strong"><strong>stack</strong></span> or <span class="strong"><strong>hyperstack</strong></span>. The extra dimensions have different names depending on the information they represent. When images are acquired in three dimensions by taking images at multiple levels of a volume, the resulting image is called a <a id="id51" class="indexterm"/>
<span class="strong"><strong>Z-stack</strong></span>. Each image in a Z-stack is referred to as a slice. When different colors are imaged, the stack is called a multichannel stack, and each image of the stack is called a channel. Finally, there is a stack that holds images that were acquired over time, where each image in the stack is called a frame. A hyperstack is a stack that contains images from more than three dimensions. For instance, a stack with slices, channels, and frames would be a 5D hyperstack. The following sections will briefly explain the different types of stacks and hyperstacks.</p><div class="section" title="Color images and multichannel stacks"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl3sec03"/>Color images and multichannel stacks</h3></div></div></div><p>Multichannel <a id="id52" class="indexterm"/>images contain individual channels that can each have their own <a id="id53" class="indexterm"/>color. An RGB image can be converted to a multichannel stack with a channel for red, green, and blue. An example of a multichannel image can be found in the image samples by selecting <span class="strong"><strong>Fluorescent Cells (400K)</strong></span>:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/Insert_image_B04909_02_02.jpg" alt="Color images and multichannel stacks"/></div><p>The window looks similar to the <span class="strong"><strong>Boats</strong></span> image. However, there is another bar at the bottom of the image window. This bar has a letter <span class="strong"><strong>C</strong></span> on the left-hand side, indicating that it has multiple channels. Each channel has its own LUT, which, in this case, is Red (channel 1), Green (channel 2), and Blue (channel 3). The bar just below the title bar now also displays some additional image information. It has the current channel indicated out of the total number of channels (1/3), and the color of the text indicates the color of the channel.</p><p>This allows for images with 16-bit information for each channel, which allows for images with a total of 48 bits of information in three channels. Internally, ImageJ can handle these files without problems, but most other programs cannot deal with these images. When saving these images, you may need to convert them to a different bit depth to use them in other programs.</p><p>ImageJ allows you to change the color of multichannel images using a lookup table. The default is Grays, but other <a id="id54" class="indexterm"/>options include Red, Green, Blue, Cyan, Magenta, and <a id="id55" class="indexterm"/>Yellow. There are also multicolor LUTs that encode intensity over a range of colors:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/Insert_image_B04909_02_03.jpg" alt="Color images and multichannel stacks"/></div><p>The preceding image shows a few examples of a range of LUTs that are available in ImageJ: from left to right green, red, cyan, and spectrum.</p></div><div class="section" title="Z-stack images and volumes"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl3sec04"/>Z-stack images and volumes</h3></div></div></div><p>When making optical <a id="id56" class="indexterm"/>sections using a microscope or an MRI machine, the <a id="id57" class="indexterm"/>resulting stack will contain information in three dimensions: <span class="emphasis"><em>X</em></span>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Y</em></span>, and <span class="emphasis"><em>Z</em></span>. Each image in this Z-stack is called a slice. Multiple slices form a volume, which can be visualized in 3D. This will be discussed in the next chapter. The appearance of the <a id="id58" class="indexterm"/>image will be the same as for a multichannel image. However, instead of <span class="strong"><strong>C</strong></span>, there will be a <span class="strong"><strong>Z</strong></span> next to the slider to indicate that the stack contains <a id="id59" class="indexterm"/>slices.</p></div><div class="section" title="Time series"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl3sec05"/>Time series</h3></div></div></div><p>When taking images <a id="id60" class="indexterm"/>at a regular time interval, the resulting stack will be a time series containing an image for each time point called a <span class="strong"><strong>frame</strong></span>. The appearance of the slider <a id="id61" class="indexterm"/>will be slightly different. Instead of a letter next to it, there will be a small play button. When you click on it, the time series will play at the speed that the time series was acquired (if the stack was calibrated).</p></div><div class="section" title="Multidimensional images"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl3sec06"/>Multidimensional images</h3></div></div></div><p>Besides multiple <a id="id62" class="indexterm"/>channels, frames (for time series) and slices (Z-stacks), it is also possible to combine all three dimensions into a single image file: a 5D image. If you open the <span class="strong"><strong>Mitosis (26MB, 5D stack)</strong></span> sample image, a new window opens with two additional sliders at the bottom of the image window:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/Insert_image_B04909_02_04.jpg" alt="Multidimensional images"/></div><p>The top slider is again for the channels (indicated by <span class="strong"><strong>C</strong></span>), the middle slider is to navigate the slices (indicated by <span class="strong"><strong>Z</strong></span>), and the last one is to navigate the time frames (indicated by the play button <span class="strong"><strong>►</strong></span>). When you click on the play button, the time series will start playing like a movie, with the <a id="id63" class="indexterm"/>speed determined by the time interval between frames. If you wish to change the speed of playback, you can right-click on the play button. Alternatively, you can go to <span class="strong"><strong>Image</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Stacks</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Animation</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Animation Options…</strong></span> from the menu and enter the speed (in frames per second). Larger values mean faster playback.</p><p>The bar below the title bar, called the subtitle, again provides additional information. It now shows the selected channel (c:1/2), slice (z:3/5), and frame (t:26/51). This time, the image is also calibrated, and the subtitle also shows the dimensions of the image in micrometers (the size in pixels is indicated between braces).</p></div></div><div class="section" title="Extracting image and pixel information"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl2sec18"/>Extracting image and pixel information</h2></div></div></div><p>If you wish to <a id="id64" class="indexterm"/>have more information about the image, you can press <span class="emphasis"><em>Ctrl</em></span> + <span class="emphasis"><em>I</em></span> (<span class="emphasis"><em>⌘</em></span>+<span class="emphasis"><em>I</em></span> on Mac) to get a new window with image information. If you do this for the 5D image, you will get the information shown in the previous image on the right-hand side. This shows a short description of the sample used as well as the dimensions of the image in calibrated units (micrometers) and pixels. It also tells you the bit depth per channel (bits per pixel: 16) and the time interval between frames that was used (frame interval: 0.14286 sec).</p><div class="note" title="Note" style=""><div class="inner"><h3 class="title"><a id="note03"/>Note</h3><p>The use of the Control key, or <span class="emphasis"><em>⌘</em></span> (command) key on Mac, for shortcuts is optional by default. You can control this by going to <span class="strong"><strong>Edit</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Options</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Misc</strong></span>. There is a checkbox labeled <span class="strong"><strong>Require control</strong></span>/<span class="strong"><strong>command key</strong></span> for shortcuts. When selected, the control/command key is required for <span class="strong"><strong>the shortcuts</strong></span> used in ImageJ. When a shortcut requires the <span class="strong"><strong>Shift</strong></span> key as well, this key is still required regardless of the setting! In this book, I will include the control/command key for shortcuts.</p></div></div><p>To see the value of a pixel, you can place your mouse cursor over the pixel of interest. In the status bar of the ImageJ main window, you can see the following information:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/Insert_image_B04909_02_05.jpg" alt="Extracting image and pixel information"/></div><p>There is information about the location of the pixel (the <span class="emphasis"><em>X</em></span> and <span class="emphasis"><em>Y</em></span> coordinates, in calibrated units if the images are calibrated) and the value (intensity or gray value). Coordinates in ImageJ are relative to the upper-left corner (origin). If a Z-stack was loaded, the current <span class="emphasis"><em>z</em></span> coordinate is also <a id="id65" class="indexterm"/>provided. In the next chapter, we will look at other measurements that can be obtained from images.</p><div class="note" title="Note" style=""><div class="inner"><h3 class="title"><a id="note04"/>Note</h3><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Note on slice indexing</strong></span>
</p><p>Note that the value given for the pixel assumes that the first slice is 0, while the information below the title bar assumes that the first slice is 1. When you start developing your own macros and plugins, this distinction can become important!</p></div></div></div><div class="section" title="Loading and saving images"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl2sec19"/>Loading and saving images</h2></div></div></div><p>Let's take a look at loading images and sequences in the following sections.</p><div class="section" title="Loading images and sequences"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl3sec07"/>Loading images and sequences</h3></div></div></div><p>As we have <a id="id66" class="indexterm"/>seen, we can load images from a URL by selecting it from the samples or going to <span class="strong"><strong>Import</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>URL</strong></span> in the <span class="strong"><strong>File</strong></span> menu. For files stored locally on the disk, we can <a id="id67" class="indexterm"/>select <span class="strong"><strong>File</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Open…</strong></span> and browse to a folder containing our images. It is also possible to drag and drop an image file onto the main ImageJ window to load it. If you drag and drop an entire folder onto the ImageJ window, all the images in that folder will be loaded.</p><p>If you have a folder containing individual pictures that you wish to open as a sequence, you can go to <span class="strong"><strong>Import</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Image Sequence…</strong></span> in the <span class="strong"><strong>File</strong></span> menu. This allows you to select the first image file of the series, after which ImageJ determines all the images that will be loaded into a single image window. It is possible to use regular expressions to limit the number of images that will be imported.</p><div class="note" title="Note" style=""><div class="inner"><h3 class="title"><a id="note05"/>Note</h3><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Importing image sequences</strong></span>
</p><p>When importing a sequence of images, all the images must be of the same type (bit depth) and have the same dimensions (width and height). If any file has dissimilar dimensions or bit depth, the import will fail and ImageJ will show an error. If other file types are in the same folder that should be ignored for importing, consider placing them in a different folder. Alternatively, you can use the regular expressions field in the import dialog to filter them out.</p></div></div><p>After the image is loaded, the window shows the filename in the title bar. When a filename is especially long, it may be beneficial to rename the window. Renaming the window can <a id="id68" class="indexterm"/>be done by selecting <span class="strong"><strong>Image</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Rename…</strong></span> from the menu or by <a id="id69" class="indexterm"/>right-clicking on the image and selecting <span class="strong"><strong>Rename…</strong></span> from the context menu.</p></div><div class="section" title="Saving images"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl3sec08"/>Saving images</h3></div></div></div><p>ImageJ allows you to <a id="id70" class="indexterm"/>save images to different file types. The preferred file type used by ImageJ is TIFF, as it allows the storage of additional meta-information, regions of interest overlays, and calibration information. ImageJ supports a wide variety of image formats. When you go to <span class="strong"><strong>File</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Save As</strong></span>, a list of image formats is presented. The JPEG and PNG formats are compressed formats. They require less disk space for storage. This means they require smaller file sizes depending on the amount of compression that is selected. The TIFF format is a lossless format, but it can support compression.</p><p>When saving images, it is important to take into account what the saved image will be used for. When you wish to quantify the image at a later time or you have to repeatedly save it, a lossy compression file format such as JPEG is not recommended. Every time you save the image as a JPEG file, a little quality is lost. Furthermore, JPEG compression is optimized for smooth color gradients, generating artifacts when applied to fluorescent images with abrupt changes in intensity. The following screenshot shows an example that was opened and saved as a JPEG file 200 times. On the left-hand side is the original image, and on the right-hand side is the saved image:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/Insert_image_B04909_02_11.jpg" alt="Saving images"/></div><p>The most apparent problem is around the eyes, where multiple artifacts of the compression can be seen. In the white of the eyes, there are now spots that were not present in the original. The skin also shows a block-like pattern. This is caused by the fact that the JPEG compression is based on blocks of 8 x 8 pixels. In this case, the image was zoomed in to 200 percent, and for a web page, this image might still be acceptable. However, this image would be unacceptable for image quantification due to the artifacts. When you need to save the image many times, or when you are not sure what further processing is required, always save the image as a TIFF file. If you require an image for a web page or <a id="id71" class="indexterm"/>presentation, you can use only 8-bit grayscale or RGB images, which can be saved in TIFF, JPG, or PNG.</p></div></div><div class="section" title="Image calibration"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl2sec20"/>Image calibration</h2></div></div></div><p>When you perform <a id="id72" class="indexterm"/>image measurements and you wish to measure distances or areas, you need to make sure that your images are calibrated in the proper units. For 2D images or 3D images, you can enter the pixel dimensions, and for time series, you can enter the time interval between frames. To do so, you can press <span class="emphasis"><em>Ctrl</em></span> + <span class="emphasis"><em>Shift</em></span> + <span class="emphasis"><em>P</em></span> (<span class="emphasis"><em>⌘</em></span> + <span class="emphasis"><em>Shift</em></span> + <span class="emphasis"><em>P</em></span> on Mac) to display the properties dialog. This allows you to set the unit of measurement (for instance, μm for micrometer) and the values for the width, height, and depth. The values indicate the number of units per pixel. For time series, the frame interval can be entered in seconds. When the <span class="strong"><strong>Global</strong></span> checkbox is checked, this calibration will be applied to all images that are opened.</p></div><div class="section" title="Viewing images in ImageJ"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl2sec21"/>Viewing images in ImageJ</h2></div></div></div><p>In order to <a id="id73" class="indexterm"/>examine an image in more detail, we may wish to use some of the tools that are available to view images in ImageJ. To show the available tools, let's use the <span class="strong"><strong>Fluorescent Cells</strong></span> images that we opened earlier. The first thing that you may wish to do is look at the detail in the image. This can be done by zooming in on the image by going to <span class="strong"><strong>Image</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Zoom</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>In [+]</strong></span> or by pressing the <span class="strong"><strong>+</strong></span> key. When zooming in, the location of the cursor determines the center of the zoom. The current zoom level is indicated in the image title bar, and the maximum zoom level is 3200 percent. When you zoom in, the window rescales until it no longer fits on the desktop. When you zoom in beyond that point, the window size stays the same and the location of the current zoom is indicated in the top-left corner as an overlay:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/Insert_image_B04909_02_06.jpg" alt="Viewing images in ImageJ"/></div><p>The large blue square represents the entire image, while the small square inside indicates the current position of <a id="id74" class="indexterm"/>the zoomed display (in this case, at the lower-left side of the image). To zoom out, select <span class="strong"><strong>Image</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Zoom</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Out [-]</strong></span> from the menu or use the <span class="strong"><strong>-</strong></span> key.</p><p>If you notice that the zoomed image shows some artifacts as shown in the following image, make sure you disabled <span class="strong"><strong>Interpolate zoomed images</strong></span> by going to <span class="strong"><strong>Edit</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Options</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Appearance…</strong></span>, as described in the first chapter:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/Insert_image_B04909_02_12.jpg" alt="Viewing images in ImageJ"/></div><p>Sometimes, when you acquire images, the exposure settings are suboptimal. This means you are not using the entire range of gray values available. In order to still see the signal, you can adjust the brightness and contrast of the image. To do so, select <span class="strong"><strong>Image</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Adjust</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Brightness/Contrast</strong></span> from the menu or press <span class="emphasis"><em>Ctrl</em></span> + <span class="emphasis"><em>Shift</em></span> + <span class="emphasis"><em>C</em></span>. This adjustment is non-destructive. It does not change the values in the image file until you press <span class="strong"><strong>Apply</strong></span> in the <span class="strong"><strong>Brightness/Contrast</strong></span> <a id="id75" class="indexterm"/>dialog for 8 and 16-bit images. The <span class="strong"><strong>Apply</strong></span> button does not work for 32-bit images. If you press <span class="strong"><strong>Reset</strong></span>, the values are restored to the initial values or to the values that were set after <span class="strong"><strong>Apply</strong></span> was pressed. If you have an underexposed (dark) image, you can make it brighter by lowering the <span class="strong"><strong>Maximum</strong></span> slider or increasing the <span class="strong"><strong>Brightness</strong></span> slider.</p><div class="note" title="Note" style=""><div class="inner"><h3 class="title"><a id="note06"/>Note</h3><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Brightness/Contrast adjustments and measurements</strong></span>
</p><p>When you adjust the <span class="strong"><strong>Brightness/Contrast</strong></span> of an image and apply it, the gray values of the image are irreversibly modified. If you still wish to perform measurements that include intensity values, applying the modifications would alter your results (and perhaps, conclusions). Only use the <span class="strong"><strong>Apply</strong></span> button when you create an image for non-critical viewing (presentations) or when measuring lengths or areas independent of intensity.</p></div></div><div class="section" title="Viewing multichannel images"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl3sec09"/>Viewing multichannel images</h3></div></div></div><p>When you have a <a id="id76" class="indexterm"/>multichannel image, you may sometimes want to hide channels from being viewed. ImageJ allows you to show or hide any channel in a multichannel image by going to <span class="strong"><strong>Image</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Color</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Channels Tool…</strong></span> in the menu or by pressing <span class="emphasis"><em>Ctrl</em></span> + <span class="emphasis"><em>Shift</em></span> + <span class="emphasis"><em>Z</em></span>. A dialog opens with a checkbox for each channel. When the <a id="id77" class="indexterm"/>box is checked, the channel is displayed. Otherwise, it is switched off (hidden). It is also possible to change the order of the channels by going to <span class="strong"><strong>Image</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Color</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Arrange Channels…</strong></span>. When modifying the <span class="strong"><strong>Brightness/Contrast</strong></span> of a multichannel image, the adjustments are only applied to the current channel that is displayed. The currently selected channel can be checked on the info bar directly underneath the title bar. The color of the histogram in the <span class="strong"><strong>Brightness/Contrast</strong></span> dialog also reflects the channel color selected.</p><div class="note" title="Note" style=""><div class="inner"><h3 class="title"><a id="note07"/>Note</h3><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Brightness/Contrast adjustments and the Channels Tool</strong></span>
</p><p>When you have hidden channels using the <span class="strong"><strong>Channels Tool</strong></span>, they can still be modified by the <span class="strong"><strong>Brightness/Contrast</strong></span> dialog. If the hidden channel is currently selected when you modify the <span class="strong"><strong>Brightness/Contrast</strong></span>, the adjustments would be made by ImageJ, but are not visible. Always verify the current channel before making adjustments!</p></div></div></div><div class="section" title="Viewing time series"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl3sec10"/>Viewing time series</h3></div></div></div><p>When viewing <a id="id78" class="indexterm"/>time series, adjustments for brightness and contrast are visible in all frames of the time series. If you wish to apply an adjustment, ImageJ <a id="id79" class="indexterm"/>will ask whether you wish to do so for the current frame or for all the frames. When you apply the settings to all the frames, the adjustment is equal for all frames, irrespective of the intensity in the frame. This means that this does not help for time series that show a decrease in fluorescence over time (that is, bleaching). Bleaching is inherent in fluorescence imaging and causes a decrease in intensity over time. Generally speaking, this effect follows an exponential decay trend. Fiji has an option to correct this bleaching process by selecting <span class="strong"><strong>Image</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Adjust</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Bleach Correction</strong></span> from the menu. For most time series that experience bleaching, the best correction method to select is <span class="strong"><strong>Exponential Fit</strong></span>. This method is more robust against changes in intensity from sources other than bleaching. If the cause for the change in intensity is different, you may want to use the <span class="strong"><strong>Simple Ratio</strong></span> method to correct the time series. Running this correction results in a new image window with the corrected data, which means that the original remains unaltered.</p></div></div></div></div>
<div class="section" title="Summary"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl1sec17"/>Summary</h1></div></div></div><p>In this chapter, we discussed the different image types that are supported by ImageJ. You also saw how to load images from a disk or from a URL. We looked at the anatomy of an image window in ImageJ and the information that can be viewed. We applied a calibration to images in order to prepare for length and area measurements. Finally, we looked at different ways of viewing different image types. You learned how to adjust the brightness and contrast of the images.</p><p>In the next chapter, we will look at ways to perform basic processing steps using the ImageJ interface.</p></div></body></html>
