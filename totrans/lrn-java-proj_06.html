			<h1 id="_idParaDest-119"><a id="_idTextAnchor119"/>Working with Arrays</h1>
			<p>Arrays are an essential data<a id="_idIndexMarker372"/> structure that you can use to store multiple values in one variable. Mastering arrays will not only make your code more organized and efficient but also open the door to more advanced programming techniques. Once you add arrays to the mix, you can level up the data structures of <span class="No-Break">your applications.</span></p>
			<p>In this chapter, we’ll explore arrays and equip you with the skills needed to effectively work with this fundamental data structure. You’ll learn how to create, manipulate, and iterate over arrays to solve a wide range of <span class="No-Break">programming challenges.</span></p>
			<p>Here’s an overview of what we’ll cover in <span class="No-Break">this chapter:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li>What arrays are and how to <span class="No-Break">use them</span></li>
				<li>Declaring and <span class="No-Break">initializing arrays</span></li>
				<li>Accessing <span class="No-Break">array elements</span></li>
				<li>Getting the length of an array and understanding <span class="No-Break">the bounds</span></li>
				<li>Different ways to loop through arrays and process <span class="No-Break">their elements</span></li>
				<li>Working with <span class="No-Break">multidimensional arrays</span></li>
				<li>Performing common operations with arrays using the <span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">Arrays</strong></span><span class="No-Break"> class</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>By the end of this chapter, you’ll have a solid foundation in working with arrays, enabling you to tackle more complex programming tasks with confidence. So, let’s <span class="No-Break">dive in!</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-120"><a id="_idTextAnchor120"/>Technical requirements</h1>
			<p>The code for this chapter can be found on GitHub <span class="No-Break">at </span><a href="https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Learn-Java-with-Projects/tree/main/ch6"><span class="No-Break">https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Learn-Java-with-Projects/tree/main/ch6</span></a><span class="No-Break">.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-121"><a id="_idTextAnchor121"/>Arrays – what, when, and why?</h1>
			<p>So far, we’ve only seen<a id="_idIndexMarker373"/> single values, such as <strong class="source-inline">int</strong>, <strong class="source-inline">double</strong>, and <strong class="source-inline">String</strong>. Imagine we want to calculate an average result. That would look something <span class="No-Break">like this:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
double result1 = 7.0;double result2 = 8.6;
double result3 = 9.0;
double total = result1 + result2 + result3;
double average = total / 3;
System.out.println(average);</pre>
			<p>This code isn’t very scalable. If we were to add a fourth result, we would need to do three things in order to make <span class="No-Break">this work:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li>Declare and initialize a <span class="No-Break">fourth variable</span></li>
				<li>Add this fourth variable to <span class="No-Break">the total</span></li>
				<li>Divide by <strong class="source-inline">4</strong> instead <span class="No-Break">of </span><span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">3</strong></span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>This is a hassle, and it is error-prone. If we knew arrays, we could alter this by only changing one element of our code. Let’s see what arrays are. Then, we will rewrite this example once we get to iterate <span class="No-Break">over arrays.</span></p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Java can’t do basic math?!</p>
			<p class="callout">If you were to run the previous code snippet, you’d see something interesting. If I asked you to calculate the average, you’d say 8.2, and you would be right. If we ask Java to do it, it <span class="No-Break">says 8.200000000000001.</span></p>
			<p class="callout">You may wonder whether there is any use in learning Java at all if it can’t do basic calculations. This is not just a Java problem; this is a general computer problem. It has to translate decimal numbers into binary numbers – much like you can’t express 1/3 in decimal numbers <span class="No-Break">exactly (0.33333).</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-122"><a id="_idTextAnchor122"/>Arrays explained</h2>
			<p>Alright, so <strong class="bold">arrays</strong> can be a solution to structure our code<a id="_idIndexMarker374"/> better in specific situations. But what are they? An array is a data structure that can store a fixed-size, ordered collection of elements of the same data type. The elements in an array are stored in contiguous memory locations, making it easier for the computer to access and manipulate <span class="No-Break">the data.</span></p>
			<p>So far, we haven’t seen a lot of situations yet where we would need them. We are really going to level up the complexity of our logic now as we learn how to work <span class="No-Break">with arrays.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-123"><a id="_idTextAnchor123"/>When to use arrays</h2>
			<p>So, let’s talk about when<a id="_idIndexMarker375"/> to use arrays. In our example earlier, where we calculated the average, an array would mean we wouldn’t need three separate variables to store our three results. We would store them in one variable of the double array type instead. This makes it easier to handle <span class="No-Break">the data.</span></p>
			<p>Arrays (as well as other types of ways to store multiple values in one variable, which we’ll see later) are <a id="_idIndexMarker376"/>used for <span class="No-Break">various reasons:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Organizing data</strong>: Arrays can help organize and manage large amounts of data in a <span class="No-Break">structured way</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Simplifying code</strong>: Using arrays can simplify your code by reducing the number of variables needed to store and <span class="No-Break">manipulate data</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Improving performance</strong>: Accessing and modifying elements in an array is faster than using other data structures because elements are stored in contiguous <span class="No-Break">memory locations</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>Being able to work with arrays is going to be a great tool in your Java toolbox! Let’s see how we can declare and <span class="No-Break">initialize them.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-124"><a id="_idTextAnchor124"/>Declaring and initializing arrays</h1>
			<p>There are different ways to declare and initialize arrays in Java. What you’ll need will depend a lot on the specific situation. So, let’s just start with the basics of <span class="No-Break">declaring arrays.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-125"><a id="_idTextAnchor125"/>Declaring arrays</h2>
			<p>To declare an array<a id="_idIndexMarker377"/> in Java, you need to specify the data type of the elements, followed by square brackets (<strong class="source-inline">[]</strong>) and the array’s name. Take the <span class="No-Break">following example:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
int[] ages;</pre>			<p>Here, <strong class="source-inline">int[]</strong> is the data type of the array, and <strong class="source-inline">ages</strong> is the name of the array. Right now, we can’t add any values to the array, because it hasn’t been initialized yet. This is different from initializing variables, which we have seen so far. Let’s see how to initialize <span class="No-Break">arrays next.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-126"><a id="_idTextAnchor126"/>Initializing arrays</h2>
			<p>After declaring<a id="_idIndexMarker378"/> an array, it needs to be initialized. We do this by specifying its size and allocating memory for the elements. We can use the <strong class="source-inline">new</strong> keyword to do this, followed by the data type, and then specify the size of the array inside the square brackets. Take the <span class="No-Break">following example:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
ages = new int[5];</pre>			<p>This code initializes the <strong class="source-inline">ages</strong> variable to hold an array of integers with a size <span class="No-Break">of </span><span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">5</strong></span><span class="No-Break">.</span></p>
			<p>We can also declare and initialize an array in a single line <span class="No-Break">of code:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
int[] ages = new int[5];</pre>			<p>Here, we first declare the array on the left-hand side and initialize it on the right-hand side. We can also assign its values directly with a special short syntax, which we will <span class="No-Break">explore next.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-127"><a id="_idTextAnchor127"/>Short syntax for array initialization</h1>
			<p>We can use Java’s shortcut<a id="_idIndexMarker379"/> syntax for declaring and initializing arrays with specific values. Instead of declaring and initializing the array separately, we can use curly braces (<strong class="source-inline">{}</strong>) to specify the elements directly. Take a look at the <span class="No-Break">following example:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
int[] ages = {31, 7, 5, 1, 0};</pre>			<p>This code creates an array of integers and initializes it with the specified values. The size of the array is determined by the number of elements inside the <span class="No-Break">curly braces.</span></p>
			<p>Actually, our previous arrays had values already as well, because when you create an array using the <strong class="source-inline">new</strong> keyword, Java automatically initializes the elements with default values based on their data type. The default values are <span class="No-Break">as follows:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li>Numeric types (<strong class="source-inline">byte</strong>, <strong class="source-inline">short</strong>, <strong class="source-inline">int</strong>, <strong class="source-inline">long</strong>, <strong class="source-inline">float</strong>, <strong class="source-inline">double</strong>): <strong class="source-inline">0</strong> <span class="No-Break">or </span><span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">0.0</strong></span></li>
				<li><strong class="source-inline">char</strong>: ‘<strong class="source-inline">\u0000</strong>’ (the Unicode <span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">null </strong></span><span class="No-Break">character)</span></li>
				<li><span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">boolean</strong></span><span class="No-Break">: </span><span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">false</strong></span></li>
				<li>Reference types (objects and <span class="No-Break">arrays): </span><span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">null</strong></span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>For example, say you create an array of integers with a size <span class="No-Break">of </span><span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">3</strong></span><span class="No-Break">:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
int[] results = new int[3];</pre>			<p>Java initializes the elements with the default value of <strong class="source-inline">0</strong>, because <strong class="source-inline">int</strong> is numeric. So far, we have seen how to declare and initialize arrays. It’s now time to learn how to access the elements in an array and update <span class="No-Break">the values.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-128"><a id="_idTextAnchor128"/>Accessing elements in an array</h1>
			<p>In order to access elements<a id="_idIndexMarker380"/> in an array, we need to use their <strong class="bold">index</strong>. The index represents the position in the array. This allows us to retrieve the value<a id="_idIndexMarker381"/> at a certain position and assign it a new value. Let’s first talk <span class="No-Break">about indexing.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-129"><a id="_idTextAnchor129"/>Understanding indexing</h2>
			<p>In Java, arrays use zero-based indexing, which means<a id="_idIndexMarker382"/> the first element has an index of <strong class="source-inline">0</strong>, the second<a id="_idIndexMarker383"/> element has an index of <strong class="source-inline">1</strong>, and so on. Take a look at our example of the <span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">ages</strong></span><span class="No-Break"> array:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
int[] ages = {31, 7, 5, 1, 0};</pre>			<p>This means that the first element (<strong class="source-inline">31</strong>) has an index of <strong class="source-inline">0</strong> and the last element has an index <span class="No-Break">of </span><span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">4</strong></span><span class="No-Break">.</span></p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer079" class="IMG---Figure">

				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 6.1 – Indexing explained with the ages array</p>
			<p>We count the length of an array like we normally do, starting with <strong class="source-inline">1</strong>. So, the length of this array would be <strong class="source-inline">5</strong>. The last element in the array has an index equal to the array’s length minus <strong class="source-inline">1</strong>. For an array with a length of N, the valid indexes are in the range of 0 <span class="No-Break">to N-1.</span></p>
			<p>It is important to know how to use the index because that way we can access the elements in <span class="No-Break">the array.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-130"><a id="_idTextAnchor130"/>Accessing array elements</h2>
			<p>To access an element<a id="_idIndexMarker384"/> in an array, you can use the array’s name, followed by the index of the desired element inside square brackets. For example, to access the first element of our array named <strong class="source-inline">ages</strong>, you can use the <span class="No-Break">following code:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
int maaikesAge = ages[0];</pre>			<p>This will store the value <strong class="source-inline">31</strong> in the <strong class="source-inline">age</strong> variable. In order to access the second element, you’d have to do <span class="No-Break">the following:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
int gaiasAge = ages[1];</pre>			<p>We can also access the element and store another value in the element using <span class="No-Break">the index.</span></p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Printing arrays</p>
			<p class="callout">If we print <a id="_idIndexMarker385"/>the variable holding the array, we can get something like <span class="No-Break">this: </span><span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">[I@28a418fc</strong></span></p>
			<p class="callout">This is not going to be very helpful. So, mind that you’re printing what the <strong class="source-inline">toString()</strong> method is returning. This is not customized for the array and is not very useful. What we most likely want to see is the elements inside the array. There is a way to print the content of arrays. We’ll see this when we cover the built-in methods for dealing <span class="No-Break">with arrays.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-131"><a id="_idTextAnchor131"/>Modifying array elements</h2>
			<p>Modifying the elements<a id="_idIndexMarker386"/> is also done with the index. It looks a lot like assigning a variable as we did before. For example, to change the value of the last element in our array, named <strong class="source-inline">ages</strong>, we can use the <span class="No-Break">following code:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
ages[4] = 37;</pre>			<p>We can only access elements that are there. If we try to get an element that is not there, we get an exception (<span class="No-Break">error) message.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-132"><a id="_idTextAnchor132"/>Working with length and bounds</h1>
			<p>To avoid getting exceptions, we need to stay within the bounds of the array. Indexes always start at <strong class="source-inline">0</strong>, and they end at the length of the array minus <strong class="source-inline">1</strong>. If you try to access an element outside this range, you’ll get <strong class="source-inline">ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException</strong>. The key to avoiding this is working with the length of <span class="No-Break">the array.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-133"><a id="_idTextAnchor133"/>Determining the length of an array</h2>
			<p>We can determine<a id="_idIndexMarker387"/> the length of an array using the <strong class="source-inline">length</strong> property. The <strong class="source-inline">length</strong> property returns the number of elements in the array. For example, to get the length of our <strong class="source-inline">ages</strong> array, we can use the <span class="No-Break">following code:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
int arrLength = ages.length;</pre>			<p>The length of the array starts counting at <strong class="source-inline">1</strong>. Therefore, the length of our <strong class="source-inline">ages</strong> array is <strong class="source-inline">5</strong>. The maximum index <span class="No-Break">is </span><span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">4</strong></span><span class="No-Break">.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-134"><a id="_idTextAnchor134"/>Dealing with the bounds of an array</h2>
			<p>If you try to access or modify<a id="_idIndexMarker388"/> an array element using an invalid index (an index that is less than 0 or greater than or equal to the array’s length), Java throws <strong class="source-inline">ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException</strong>. This exception is a runtime error, which means it occurs when the program is running, not when we compile it. We’ll learn more about exceptions in <a href="B19793_11.xhtml#_idTextAnchor266"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 11</em></span></a><span class="No-Break">.</span></p>
			<p>To prevent <strong class="source-inline">ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsExceptions</strong>, we should always validate array indexes before using them to access or modify array elements. We can do this by checking whether the index is within the valid range (<strong class="source-inline">0</strong> to array length - 1). Here’s an example that demonstrates how to validate an <span class="No-Break">array index:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
String[] names = {"Maria", "Fatiha", "Pradeepa", "Sarah"};int index = 5;
if (index &gt;= 0 &amp;&amp; index &lt; names.length) {
    System.out.println("Element at index " + index + ": " +
      names[index]);
} else {
    System.out.println("Invalid index: " + index);
}</pre>
			<p>The output will be <span class="No-Break">as follows:</span></p>
			<pre class="console">
Invalid index: 5</pre>			<p>This code snippet checks whether the index is within the valid range before accessing the array element. If the index is invalid, the program prints an error message instead of throwing <span class="No-Break">an exception.</span></p>
			<p>We can also use the loops we learned about in the previous chapter to iterate over the elements in an array and access or modify <span class="No-Break">their values.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-135"><a id="_idTextAnchor135"/>Iterating over arrays</h1>
			<p>There are <a id="_idIndexMarker389"/>different methods to iterate over arrays. We will have a look at the use of the traditional <strong class="source-inline">for</strong> loop and the enhanced <strong class="source-inline">for</strong> loop (also known as the <span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">for-each</strong></span><span class="No-Break"> loop).</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-136"><a id="_idTextAnchor136"/>Using the for loop</h2>
			<p>We <a id="_idIndexMarker390"/>can use <a id="_idIndexMarker391"/>the traditional <strong class="source-inline">for</strong> loop to iterate over an array by using an index variable. The loop starts at index <strong class="source-inline">0</strong> and continues until the index reaches the length of the array. Here’s an example that demonstrates how to use a <strong class="source-inline">for</strong> loop to iterate over an array and print <span class="No-Break">its elements:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
int[] results = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50};for (int i = 0; i &lt; results.length; i++) {
    System.out.println("Element at " + i + ": " +
      results[i]);
}</pre>
			<p>The output will be <span class="No-Break">as follows:</span></p>
			<pre class="console">
Element at 0: 10Element at 1: 20
Element at 2: 30
Element at 3: 40
Element at 4: 50</pre>
			<p>At this point, we know enough to revisit the example that we saw at the beginning of the chapter, calculating the average of several results. Instead of having separate primitives, we’re now going to have an array. Here is what it will <span class="No-Break">look like:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
double[] results = {7.0, 8.6, 9.0};double total = 0;
for(int i = 0; i &lt; results.length; i++) {
    total += results[i];
}
double average = total / results.length;
System.out.println(average);</pre>
			<p>If we now<a id="_idIndexMarker392"/> want to add a result, we only need to alter it in one place. We just add the result to the <strong class="source-inline">results</strong> array. Since we loop over all the<a id="_idIndexMarker393"/> elements, we don’t need to add an extra variable to calculate the total result. Also, since we use the length, we don’t need to change <strong class="source-inline">3</strong> <span class="No-Break">to </span><span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">4</strong></span><span class="No-Break">.</span></p>
			<p>We can also use loops to modify the values of the array. Here’s an example that demonstrates how to double the value of each element in an array using a <span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">for</strong></span><span class="No-Break"> loop:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
int[] results = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50};// Double the value of each element
for (int i = 0; i &lt; results.length; i++) {
    results[i] = results[i] * 2;
}
// Print the updated array elements
for (int i = 0; i &lt; results.length; i++) {
    System.out.println("Element at " + i + ": " +
      results[i]);
}</pre>
			<p>The output will be <span class="No-Break">as follows:</span></p>
			<pre class="console">
Element at 0: 20Element at 1: 40
Element at 2: 60
Element at 3: 80
Element at 4: 100</pre>
			<p>As you can see, the elements in the array are doubled in the first <strong class="source-inline">for</strong> loop. In the second <strong class="source-inline">for</strong> loop, they <a id="_idIndexMarker394"/>are printed. As you can tell by the<a id="_idIndexMarker395"/> output, the values <span class="No-Break">did double!</span></p>
			<p>Let’s have a look at the enhanced <strong class="source-inline">for</strong> loop and how we can use that to iterate <span class="No-Break">over arrays.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-137"><a id="_idTextAnchor137"/>Using the for each loop</h2>
			<p>We can<a id="_idIndexMarker396"/> also the  <strong class="source-inline">for-each</strong> loop, also known as<a id="_idIndexMarker397"/> the enhanced for loop, to iterate over arrays. This special <strong class="source-inline">for</strong> loop simplifies the process of iterating over arrays (and other iterable objects). The <strong class="source-inline">for-each</strong> loop automatically iterates over the elements in the array and does not require an index variable. Here’s an example that demonstrates how to use the <strong class="source-inline">for-each</strong> loop to iterate over an array and print <span class="No-Break">its elements:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
int[] results = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50};for (int result : results) {
    System.out.println("Element: " + result);
}</pre>
			<p>The output will be <span class="No-Break">as follows:</span></p>
			<pre class="console">
Element: 10Element: 20
Element: 30
Element: 40
Element: 50</pre>
			<p>The <strong class="source-inline">for-each</strong> loop requires a temporary variable that is used to store the current element during each iteration. In our example, this is <strong class="source-inline">int result</strong>. It is logical to call it <strong class="source-inline">result</strong>, since it is one element in the <strong class="source-inline">results</strong> array. But this is not necessary for the functionality; I could have also called it <strong class="source-inline">x</strong>, <span class="No-Break">as follows:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
int[] results = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50};for (int x : results) {
    System.out.println("Element: " + x);
}</pre>
			<p>The output<a id="_idIndexMarker398"/> would have been exactly the same. I like to<a id="_idIndexMarker399"/> read the line of code that says <strong class="source-inline">for (int x : results)</strong> in my head like this: for every element <strong class="source-inline">x</strong> in <strong class="source-inline">results</strong>, do whatever is in the <span class="No-Break">code block.</span></p>
			<p>So there are two ways to loop over arrays, let’s talk about which one to <span class="No-Break">choose when.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-138"><a id="_idTextAnchor138"/>Choosing between the regular loop and the enhanced for loop</h2>
			<p>We can use the regular <strong class="source-inline">for</strong> loop and the (enhanced) <strong class="source-inline">for-each</strong> loop to iterate over an array. These two approaches have some differences and there’s a reason for choosing one or <span class="No-Break">the other.</span></p>
			<p>When you need to have the index available, you should use the traditional <strong class="source-inline">for</strong> loop since this uses an index variable to access the elements in the array, while the <strong class="source-inline">for-each</strong> loop directly accesses the elements without using an <span class="No-Break">index variable.</span></p>
			<p>The <strong class="source-inline">for-each</strong> loop does not allow you to modify the array elements during iteration, as it does not provide access to the index variable. If you need to modify the array elements during iteration, you should use the traditional <span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">for</strong></span><span class="No-Break"> loop.</span></p>
			<p>If you only want to read the variables and you don’t need the index, you typically want to go for the <strong class="source-inline">for-each </strong>loop because the syntax <span class="No-Break">is easier.</span></p>
			<p>Alright, so now we know how to iterate over arrays. Let’s make the data structure slightly more complicated and learn about <span class="No-Break">multidimensional arrays.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-139"><a id="_idTextAnchor139"/>Handling multidimensional arrays</h1>
			<p>A <strong class="bold">multidimensional array</strong> is an array of arrays. In Java, you can create<a id="_idIndexMarker400"/> arrays with two or more dimensions. The most common type of multidimensional array<a id="_idIndexMarker401"/> is the two-dimensional array, also known as a matrix or a table, where the elements are arranged in rows <span class="No-Break">and columns.</span></p>
			<p>Let’s see how to create <span class="No-Break">multidimensional arrays.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-140"><a id="_idTextAnchor140"/>Declaring and initializing multidimensional arrays</h2>
			<p>To declare<a id="_idIndexMarker402"/> a two-dimensional array, you need to specify the data type of the elements, followed by two sets of square brackets (<strong class="source-inline">[][]</strong>) and the name of the array. Take the <span class="No-Break">following example:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
int[][] matrix;</pre>			<p>Just like the one-dimensional array, we initialize a two-dimensional array with the use of the <strong class="source-inline">new</strong> keyword, followed by the data type and the size of each dimension inside the square brackets, <span class="No-Break">like this:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
matrix = new int[3][4];</pre>			<p>This code initializes<a id="_idIndexMarker403"/> a matrix of <strong class="source-inline">3</strong> rows and <strong class="source-inline">4</strong> columns. The type is <strong class="source-inline">int</strong>, so we know that the values of the matrix <span class="No-Break">are integers.</span></p>
			<p>We can also declare and initialize a multidimensional array in a <span class="No-Break">single line:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
int[][] matrix = new int[3][4];</pre>			<p>We can use the short syntax as well. To initialize a multidimensional array with specific values, we use the nested curly <span class="No-Break">braces (</span><span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">{}</strong></span><span class="No-Break">):</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
int[][] matrix = {    {1, 2, 3, 4},
    {5, 6, 7, 8},
    {9, 10, 11, 12}
};</pre>
			<p>Just like the one-dimensional arrays, Java determines the length by the provided values. This matrix has three inner arrays (three rows) each with four elements (four columns). Accessing and modifying the elements in a multidimensional array is similar, but we now need to provide <span class="No-Break">two indices.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-141"><a id="_idTextAnchor141"/>Accessing and modifying elements of multidimensional arrays</h2>
			<p>To access or modify the elements<a id="_idIndexMarker404"/> of a multidimensional array, you need<a id="_idIndexMarker405"/> to specify the indexes of each dimension inside square brackets. For example, to access the element in the first row and second column of a two-dimensional array named <strong class="source-inline">matrix</strong>, you can use the <span class="No-Break">following code:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
int element = matrix[0][1];</pre>			<p>To modify the same element, you can use the <span class="No-Break">following code:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
matrix[0][1] = 42;</pre>			<p><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Figure 6</em></span><em class="italic">.2</em> shows how the indexing works for our two-dimensional <span class="No-Break">array, </span><span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">matrix</strong></span><span class="No-Break">.</span></p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer080" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B19793_06_2.jpg" alt="Figure 6.2 – The index of the rows and columns for array matrix"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 6.2 – The index of the rows and columns for array matrix</p>
			<p>So, if we want to get to the element with value <strong class="source-inline">12</strong> and store it in a <strong class="source-inline">last</strong> variable, our code will be <span class="No-Break">as follows:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
int last = matrix[2][3];</pre>			<p>We can also iterate over all the variables in a multidimensional array. Let’s see how that <span class="No-Break">is done.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-142"><a id="_idTextAnchor142"/>Iterating over multidimensional arrays</h2>
			<p>Since a multidimensional array<a id="_idIndexMarker406"/> is just an array in an array, we can use nested loops to iterate over multidimensional arrays. Here’s an example that demonstrates how we can use a nested <strong class="source-inline">for</strong> loop to iterate over a <span class="No-Break">two-dimensional array:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
int[][] matrix = {    {1, 2, 3, 4},
    {5, 6, 7, 8},
    {9, 10, 11, 12}
};
for (int i = 0; i &lt; matrix.length; i++) {
    for (int j = 0; j &lt; matrix[i].length; j++) {
        System.out.print(matrix[i][j] + " ");
    }
    System.out.println();
}</pre>
			<p>The output will be <span class="No-Break">as follows:</span></p>
			<pre class="console">
1 2 3 45 6 7 8
9 10 11 12</pre>
			<p>All we do at this point is just print the element. This is something we can also do with the enhanced <strong class="source-inline">for</strong> loop to iterate over multidimensional arrays. Here’s an example that demonstrates how to <span class="No-Break">do that:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
int[][] matrix = {    {1, 2, 3, 4},
    {5, 6, 7, 8},
    {9, 10, 11, 12}
};
for (int[] row : matrix) {
    for (int element : row) {
        System.out.print(element + " ");
    }
    System.out.println();
}</pre>
			<p>The output will be the same as in the <span class="No-Break">previous example:</span></p>
			<pre class="console">
1 2 3 45 6 7 8
9 10 11 12</pre>
			<p>As you can see, the outer <strong class="source-inline">for-each</strong> loop iterates over the rows of the two-dimensional array. The row is an array itself as well, which is why the type is <strong class="source-inline">int[]</strong>. The inner <strong class="source-inline">for-each</strong> loop iterates over the elements within each row. These <span class="No-Break">are integers.</span></p>
			<p>Both traditional nested <strong class="source-inline">for</strong> loops and nested <strong class="source-inline">for-each</strong> loops can be used to iterate over multidimensional arrays. It’s a matter of preference and whether you need to access the index of <span class="No-Break">the elements.</span></p>
			<p>Arrays can go very many levels deep, but that doesn’t really change the basic principles. For example, for a four-dimensional array, you’ll have <strong class="source-inline">[][][][]</strong> behind the type and you need a nested loop<a id="_idIndexMarker407"/> of four levels to iterate over all <span class="No-Break">the elements.</span></p>
			<p>Java helps us deal with arrays in different ways. Let’s look at some built-in methods for arrays that we <span class="No-Break">can use.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-143"><a id="_idTextAnchor143"/>Using Java’s built-in methods for arrays</h1>
			<p>Working with <a id="_idIndexMarker408"/>arrays is very common. Usually, for very <a id="_idIndexMarker409"/>common things, Java has built-in functionality. We can do many common things we’d like to do with arrays with the use of the methods on the built-in <span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">Arrays</strong></span><span class="No-Break"> class.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-144"><a id="_idTextAnchor144"/>Built-in Arrays class for working with arrays</h2>
			<p>The built-in <strong class="source-inline">Arrays</strong> class<a id="_idIndexMarker410"/> is a helper class in the <strong class="source-inline">java.util</strong> package. It <a id="_idIndexMarker411"/>offers many utility methods to help us efficiently work with arrays. We’ll explore some common array manipulation tasks using the <span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">Arrays</strong></span><span class="No-Break"> class.</span></p>
			<h3>The toString() method</h3>
			<p>A highly useful<a id="_idIndexMarker412"/> operation you may want to perform on an array is <a id="_idIndexMarker413"/>to convert it into a <strong class="source-inline">String</strong>, which can be invaluable for debugging and logging purposes. To achieve this, the <strong class="source-inline">Arrays</strong> class offers a dedicated method called <strong class="source-inline">toString()</strong>. It’s important to note that this method is static, allowing us to call it directly on the <span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">Arrays</strong></span><span class="No-Break"> class.</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
import java.util.Arrays;public class ArrayHelperMethods {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] results = {30, 10, 50, 20, 40};
        // Convert the array to a string representation
        String arrayAsString = Arrays.toString(results);
        System.out.println("Array: " + arrayAsString);
    }
}</pre>
			<p>The output will be <span class="No-Break">as follows:</span></p>
			<pre class="console">
Array: [30, 10, 50, 20, 40]</pre>			<p>As you can see, the <strong class="source-inline">results</strong> array is converted to a string that represents the array’s elements, enclosed by square brackets and separated by commas. There are many such methods on the <strong class="source-inline">Arrays</strong> class! Let’s explore the <strong class="source-inline">sort</strong> <span class="No-Break">method next.</span></p>
			<h3>The sort() method</h3>
			<p>A common operation<a id="_idIndexMarker414"/> you want to do on an array is to sort the array. Here’s an example that shows how<a id="_idIndexMarker415"/> to sort the values of an array with the <strong class="source-inline">sort</strong> method from the <span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">Arrays</strong></span><span class="No-Break"> class:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
import java.util.Arrays;public class ArrayHelperMethods {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] results = {30, 10, 50, 20, 40};
        // Sort the array
        Arrays.sort(results);
        System.out.println(Arrays.toString(results));
    }
}</pre>
			<p>The output will be <span class="No-Break">as follows:</span></p>
			<pre class="console">
[10, 20, 30, 40, 50]</pre>			<p>As you can see, the <strong class="source-inline">results</strong> array is unsorted at first. We can call the methods on the <strong class="source-inline">Arrays</strong> class directly on the <strong class="source-inline">Arrays</strong> class because they’re static. For integer values, it sorts them from low to high by default. We can alter this behavior, but we don’t have the knowledge we need to do that <span class="No-Break">just yet.</span></p>
			<p>We print the array with another built-in method, namely <strong class="source-inline">toString</strong>. This translates the array into something that we <span class="No-Break">can understand.</span></p>
			<p>When the array is sorted, we can use the <strong class="source-inline">binarySearch</strong> method to find <span class="No-Break">a value.</span></p>
			<h3>The binarySearch() method</h3>
			<p>We can also search<a id="_idIndexMarker416"/> for a value in an array. We are going<a id="_idIndexMarker417"/> to use the built-in <strong class="source-inline">binarySearch</strong> method to do this. Very importantly, this can only be done with sorted arrays because of how the search algorithm works. Here’s an example of how to <span class="No-Break">do this:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
import java.util.Arrays;public class ArrayHelperMethods {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] results = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50};
        int target = 30;
        int index = Arrays.binarySearch(results, target);
        System.out.println("Index of " + target + ": " +
          index);
    }
}</pre>
			<p>The output will be <span class="No-Break">as follows:</span></p>
			<pre class="console">
Index of 30: 2</pre>			<p>The <strong class="source-inline">binarySearch</strong> method<a id="_idIndexMarker418"/> requires <a id="_idIndexMarker419"/>the input array to be sorted beforehand. The <strong class="source-inline">binarySearch</strong> algorithm is meant for finding a target value within a sorted array. Instead of searching the array element by element, it divides the array into halves repeatedly until it finds the target or the remaining portion to search becomes empty. When the value at the half is bigger, it knows it needs to move towards the left side of the array, when it’s smaller it knows it needs to move towards the right. That’s why it’s a must that the array is sorted. The <strong class="source-inline">binarySearch </strong>method returns the index of the target value if found. If the target wasn’t found, it returns a negative value, which represents the insertion point. So, say we updated our code <span class="No-Break">to this:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
        int[] results = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50};        int target = 31;
        int index = Arrays.binarySearch(results, target);
        System.out.println("Index of " + target + ": " +
          index);</pre>
			<p>This would result in <span class="No-Break">the following:</span></p>
			<pre class="console">
Index of 31: -4</pre>			<p>This is because it would have been at the fourth position in the array (not the <span class="No-Break">fourth index!).</span></p>
			<p>Let’s see how we can give<a id="_idIndexMarker420"/> all the elements in the array a specific<a id="_idIndexMarker421"/> value with the <span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">fill</strong></span><span class="No-Break"> method.</span></p>
			<h3>The fill() method</h3>
			<p>Sometimes, you want<a id="_idIndexMarker422"/> to create an array<a id="_idIndexMarker423"/> of the same values programmatically. Here’s an example of how this can be done. We use the <strong class="source-inline">fill</strong> method from the <strong class="source-inline">Arrays</strong> class. Here’s how to <span class="No-Break">do it:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
import java.util.Arrays;public class ArrayHelperMethods {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] results = new int[5];
        Arrays.fill(results, 42);
        System.out.println(Arrays.toString(results));
    }
}</pre>
			<p>The output will be <span class="No-Break">as follows:</span></p>
			<pre class="console">
[42, 42, 42, 42, 42]</pre>			<p>The <strong class="source-inline">fill</strong> method sets all elements in the array to the specified value. Sometimes we need to create a copy<a id="_idIndexMarker424"/> of our array<a id="_idIndexMarker425"/> or resize it. In that case, we can use the <span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">copyOf</strong></span><span class="No-Break"> method.</span></p>
			<h3>The copyOf() method</h3>
			<p>Sometimes you need to create<a id="_idIndexMarker426"/> a copy of an array, for example, when you want<a id="_idIndexMarker427"/> to end it to another location in the application, but you don’t want this to affect your <span class="No-Break">original array.</span></p>
			<p>This is an example of how we can create a copy of <span class="No-Break">an array:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
import java.util.Arrays;public class ArrayHelperMethods {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] results = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50};
        int[] copiedResults = Arrays.copyOf(results,
          results.length);
        System.out.println(Arrays.toString(copiedResults));
    }
}</pre>
			<p>The output will be <span class="No-Break">as follows:</span></p>
			<pre class="console">
[10, 20, 30, 40, 50]</pre>			<p>We can prove we copied the array with the <span class="No-Break">following code:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
copiedResults[0] = 1000;System.out.println(Arrays.toString(copiedResults));
System.out.println(Arrays.toString(results));</pre>
			<p>If we didn’t create a copy but just stored it in another variable instead, it would alter both arrays. The preceding code snippet will give the <span class="No-Break">following output:</span></p>
			<pre class="console">
[1000, 20, 30, 40, 50][10, 20, 30, 40, 50]</pre>
			<p>But say we have <span class="No-Break">this code:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
int[] copiedResults = results;copiedResults[0] = 1000;
System.out.println(Arrays.toString(copiedResults));
System.out.println(Arrays.toString(results));</pre>
			<p>It will give us <span class="No-Break">this output:</span></p>
			<pre class="console">
[1000, 20, 30, 40, 50][1000, 20, 30, 40, 50]</pre>
			<p>As you can see, this alters both the variables holding the array. This is because both variables, <strong class="source-inline">copiedResults</strong> and <strong class="source-inline">results</strong>, have the same array object that they’re pointing to. So, if you change it in one place, it changes for both. That’s why you sometimes need to create copies <span class="No-Break">of arrays.</span></p>
			<p>So, the <strong class="source-inline">copyOf</strong> method creates a new array with the same elements as the original array, whereas this second method just creates a new variable that points to the same array object. We can also use it to resize<a id="_idIndexMarker428"/> the array by passing<a id="_idIndexMarker429"/> in a <span class="No-Break">second argument.</span></p>
			<h3>Resizing arrays with copyOf()</h3>
			<p>Arrays have<a id="_idIndexMarker430"/> a fixed size, but sometimes <a id="_idIndexMarker431"/>you need to alter the size nonetheless. The <strong class="source-inline">Arrays.copyOf()</strong> method<a id="_idIndexMarker432"/> that we just saw is also useful for resizing arrays. To resize an array, you can create a new array with the desired size and copy the elements from the original array to the new array. All you need to do is give it a <span class="No-Break">second argument.</span></p>
			<p>Here’s an example that demonstrates how <span class="No-Break">to resize:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
import java.util.Arrays;int[] originalArray = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50};
int newLength = 7;
int[] resizedArray = Arrays.copyOf(originalArray, newLength);
System.out.println("Original array: " + Arrays.toString(originalArray));
System.out.println("Resized array: " + Arrays.toString(resizedArray));</pre>
			<p>The output will be <span class="No-Break">as follows:</span></p>
			<pre class="console">
Original array: [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]Resized array: [10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 0, 0]</pre>
			<p>In this example, we resized <strong class="source-inline">originalArray</strong>, which had a length of <strong class="source-inline">5</strong>, to a new length of <strong class="source-inline">7</strong>. The new array contains the elements of the original array, followed by default values (<strong class="source-inline">0</strong> for <strong class="source-inline">int</strong>) to fill the <span class="No-Break">remaining positions.</span></p>
			<p>This is not something you should be doing constantly. It can be inefficient in terms of performance. If you would<a id="_idIndexMarker433"/> need to resize<a id="_idIndexMarker434"/> your array a lot, it’s worth<a id="_idIndexMarker435"/> having a look at <a href="B19793_13.xhtml#_idTextAnchor317"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 13</em></span></a> where we learn <span class="No-Break">about </span><span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">collections</strong></span><span class="No-Break">.</span></p>
			<h3>The equals() method</h3>
			<p>The last built-in method<a id="_idIndexMarker436"/> we’re going to discuss is the <strong class="source-inline">equals()</strong> method. This method<a id="_idIndexMarker437"/> can determine whether two arrays have the same values. With this built-in method, you can compare two arrays for equality. Here’s how to go <span class="No-Break">about it:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
import java.util.Arrays;public class ArrayHelperMethods {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] results1 = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50};
        int[] results2 = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50};
        boolean arraysEqual = Arrays.equals(results1,
          results2);
        System.out.println("Are the arrays equal? " +
          arraysEqual);
    }
}</pre>
			<p>The output will be <span class="No-Break">as follows:</span></p>
			<pre class="console">
Are the arrays equal? true</pre>			<p>The <strong class="source-inline">equals()</strong> method compares two arrays element by element to check whether they have the same values in the same<a id="_idIndexMarker438"/> order. It returns <strong class="source-inline">true</strong> if the arrays<a id="_idIndexMarker439"/> are equal; otherwise, it <span class="No-Break">returns </span><span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">false</strong></span><span class="No-Break">.</span></p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Well done!</p>
			<p class="callout">You’ve done a great job learning arrays! At this point, you’re ready to understand this <span class="No-Break">programming joke:</span></p>
			<p class="callout">Why did the Java developer quit <span class="No-Break">their job?</span></p>
			<p class="callout">Because they couldn’t <span class="No-Break">get “arrays!”</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-145"><a id="_idTextAnchor145"/>Exercises</h1>
			<p>Arrays are incredibly useful for storing and managing similar types of data, such as a list of dinosaur names, dinosaur weights, and visitors’ favorite snacks. Arrays are helpful and they enable us to manage more complex data in Mesozoic Eden. Try out <span class="No-Break">the following:</span></p>
			<ol>
				<li>The unique appeal of our park lies in the diversity of our dinosaur species. (And also in that we have dinosaurs at all.) Create an array that holds the names of all the dinosaur species in the park. This list will help us in <span class="No-Break">inventory management.</span></li>
				<li>Every visitor has their favorite dinosaur, and for many, it’s the heaviest one. Write a program that finds this star’s weight in an array of dinosaur weights. This information can then be highlighted in our park tours and <span class="No-Break">educational programs.</span></li>
				<li>Dinosaurs come in all sizes, and the smallest ones hold a special place in the hearts of children. Write a program that finds this smallest dinosaur in an array of <span class="No-Break">dinosaur weights.</span></li>
				<li>Running a dinosaur park is not a one-man show and requires a dedicated team of employees. Create an array of park employee names and print out the names using an enhanced <strong class="source-inline">for</strong> loop. This will help us to appreciate and manage our staff <span class="No-Break">more effectively.</span></li>
				<li>To ensure the well-being of our dinosaur inhabitants, it’s essential to monitor their average age. This data can help inform our care and feeding programs to better suit the age profile of our dinosaurs. Write a program that calculates this using an array of <span class="No-Break">dinosaur ages.</span></li>
				<li>Our park is meticulously divided into various sections to facilitate visitor navigation and dinosaur housing. Create a two-dimensional array representing the park map, with each cell containing an array of Strings indicating an enclosure or facility for a <span class="No-Break">certain section.</span></li>
				<li>The enjoyment of a park tour depends significantly on comfortable seating arrangements. Use nested loops to print out a seating chart for a park tour bus from a two-dimensional array. This will help us ensure that every guest has a pleasant journey throughout <span class="No-Break">the park.</span></li>
			</ol>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-146"><a id="_idTextAnchor146"/>Project – Dino tracker</h1>
			<p>Safety always <a id="_idIndexMarker440"/>comes first. That’s why keeping track of all our dinosaur residents is of utmost importance. The park managers need to have an easy-to-use system for managing information about their slightly <span class="No-Break">exotic pets.</span></p>
			<p>For this project, you’ll be creating a Dino tracker. This is a simple tracking system that maintains records of each dinosaur’s name, age, species, and enclosure number. This will be done using fixed arrays – four arrays in total, one for <span class="No-Break">each attribute.</span></p>
			<p>Assume you have room for 10 dinosaurs in your park for now, so each array should have a length of 10. Each dinosaur will correspond to an index in the array. For example, if the dinosaur “Rex” is in the first position of the name array, his age, species, and enclosure number will also be in the first position of their <span class="No-Break">respective arrays.</span></p>
			<p>You’re going to print information about all the dinosaurs and print their average age and weight <span class="No-Break">after that.</span></p>
			<p>I realize this might be a lot. If you need some extra guidance, here are some steps to guide you through <span class="No-Break">the process:</span></p>
			<ol>
				<li><strong class="bold">Initialization</strong>: Start by creating four arrays: <strong class="source-inline">dinoNames</strong>, <strong class="source-inline">dinoAges</strong>, <strong class="source-inline">dinoSpecies</strong>, and <strong class="source-inline">dinoEnclosures</strong>. Each should have a size <span class="No-Break">of 10.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Data entry</strong>: Manually enter the details for ten dinosaurs into the arrays. This is to populate your arrays with some initial data. If you’re feeling lazy, like the Brachiosaurus, you could have <strong class="source-inline">Dinosaur1</strong>, <strong class="source-inline">Dinosaur2</strong>, and so on <span class="No-Break">as names.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Displaying details</strong>: Write a loop that goes through the arrays and prints out the details of each dinosaur in a <span class="No-Break">readable format.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Average calculations</strong>: Add the end, print the average age and weight of the dinosaurs. For the ages, you will need to sum up all the ages in the <strong class="source-inline">dinoAges</strong> array and divide <a id="_idIndexMarker441"/>by the number of dinosaurs. And, of course, this process is similar for weight, but using the <span class="No-Break">weight array.</span></li>
			</ol>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-147"><a id="_idTextAnchor147"/>Summary</h1>
			<p>In this chapter, we have explored arrays in Java. Arrays are data structures that allow us to store multiple values of the same data type in a contiguous block of memory. They provide an efficient way to organize lists <span class="No-Break">of data.</span></p>
			<p>We began by discussing the declaration and initialization of arrays. We learned about different ways to declare and initialize arrays, including using the shortcut syntax for array initialization. We also covered how to initialize arrays with <span class="No-Break">default values.</span></p>
			<p>After that, we discussed how to access and modify array elements using indexes. We learned about the importance of the array length and that we can find out the length by using the <strong class="source-inline">length</strong> property. We also talked about avoiding <strong class="source-inline">ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsExceptions</strong> by validating <span class="No-Break">array indexes.</span></p>
			<p>We then looked at iterating over arrays using both the traditional <strong class="source-inline">for</strong> loop and the enhanced <strong class="source-inline">for</strong> loop (the <span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">for-each</strong></span><span class="No-Break"> loop).</span></p>
			<p>After this, we explored multidimensional arrays, which are arrays of arrays, and learned how to declare, initialize, and access their elements. We also discussed how to iterate over <span class="No-Break">multidimensional arrays.</span></p>
			<p>Finally, we covered common array operations with the use of the <strong class="source-inline">Arrays</strong> class and its built-in methods. We saw how to sort arrays, search for elements in a sorted array, fill an array with a specific value, copy and resize an array, and <span class="No-Break">compare arrays.</span></p>
			<p>By mastering these concepts, you now have a solid foundation for working with arrays in Java. This understanding will help you store and manipulate data more efficiently in your Java programs. We ended by looking at some built-in methods. In the next chapter, you’re going to learn how to write your <span class="No-Break">own methods.</span></p>
