We're pleased that you have chosen our book, fully dedicated to the essentials of Spring Batch 3.0.2 release. Before we get started with this book, I would like to give an overview of how this book is organized and how you can get the most out of it. Once you have completed reading this book, you should be familiar with key batch processing concepts and understand how to solve the majority of the real-world problems that you will need to solve with Spring Batch. This book gives an insight of the essential concepts and applications of the Spring Batch framework, which will allow you to handle any unexpected use cases the book does not cover.</p><p>Spring Batch is an open source, lightweight, and comprehensive solution, designed to enable the development of robust batch applications, vital for enterprise operations.</p><p>This tutorial starts with an insight into batch applications and Spring Batch offerings. Understanding the architecture and key components, you will learn how to develop and execute a batch application. You can then walk through the essential configurations and execution techniques, key technical implementations of the read and write, and processing features of different forms of data. Next, you will move onto the key features, such as transaction management, job flows, job monitoring, and data sharing across the steps of the executing jobs. Finally, you will learn how Spring Batch can integrate with diverse enterprise technologies and facilitate optimization and performance improvement with scaling and partitioning techniques.</p><p>This book uses a simple application based on Spring Batch to illustrate how to solve real-world problems. The application is intended to be very simple and straightforward, and purposely contains very little functionality—the goal of this application is to encourage you to focus on the Spring Batch concepts, and not get tied up in the complexities of application development. You will have a much easier time following the book if you take the time to review the sample application source code. Some tips on getting started are found in the appendix.</p><div class="section" title="What this book covers"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl1sec02"/>What this book covers</h1></div></div></div><p>
