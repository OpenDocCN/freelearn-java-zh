- en: Security is one of the most difficult and high-pressured concerns of creating
    an application. The complexity of properly securing an application is compounded
    when you must integrate this with existing code, new technologies, and other frameworks.
    This book will show readers how to easily secure their Java applications with
    the tied-and-tested Spring Security framework, the highly customizable and powerful authentication
    and authorization framework.

- en: Spring Security is a well-known and established Java/JEE framework that can
    provide enterprise-grade security features for your application with no trouble.
    It also has modules that enable us to integrate with a variety of authentication
    mechanisms, and we will be delving into each of those using hands-on coding in
    this book.

- en: Many examples will still be explained using the Spring MVC web application framework,
    but will still have a flavor of reactive programming to them.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Reactive programming is gaining traction, and this aspect of Spring Security
    will be covered by showcasing Spring Security integration with the Spring WebFlux
    web application framework. In addition to reactive programming, the book will
    also delve into other Spring Security features in detail.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Finally, we will also bring in some of the products available on the market
    that can be used along with Spring Security to achieve some of the security features
    needed in modern applications. These products offer new/enhanced security capabilities,
    and work in harmony with Spring Security in all aspects. Some of the products
    discussed are also fully endorsed and supported by the Spring community.

- en: '[Chapter 1](bb1f1c6e-a9a4-4a14-aff4-3510fbfa7d14.xhtml), *Overview of Spring
    5 and Spring Security 5*, introduces you to the new application requirements and
    then introduces you to reactive programming concepts. It touches on application
    security and what Spring Security brings to the table to address security concerns
    in an application. The chapter then gets into a bit more into Spring Security
    and then finally closes by explaining how the examples in this book are structured.'

    Spring Security*, deep dives into the technical capability of core Spring Security;
    namely, Authentication and Authorization. The chapter then gets your hands dirty
    with some example code, in which we will set up a project using Spring Security.
    Then, in due course introduces you to the approach by which the code samples will
    be explained throughout the book.'

    SAML, LDAP, and OAuth/OIDC*, introduces you to three authentication mechanisms;
    namely, SAML, LDAP, and OAuth/OIDC. This is the first of two main chapters, in
    which we will dive deep into various authentication mechanisms supported by Spring
    Security using hands-on coding. We will be explaining each authentication mechanism
    using a simple example to cover the crux of the topic, and we''ll be keeping the
    example simple for easy understanding.'

    CAS and JAAS*, introduces you to two more authentication mechanisms that are very
    much prevalent in enterprises—CAS and JAAS. This is the second of the two main
    chapters, similar to [Chapter 3](https://cdp.packtpub.com/hands_on_spring_security_5_for_reactive_applications/wp-admin/post.php?post=25&action=edit#post_28),
    *Authentication Using SAML, LDAP, and OAuth/OIDC*, which will initially cover
    the theoretical aspects of these authentication mechanisms. This chapter concludes
    the topic by implementing a fully-fledged example using Spring Security.'

    Spring 5—Spring WebFlux. Spring WebFlux is a web application framework in the
    Spring ecosystem that was built from the ground up to be fully reactive. We will
    bring the reactive parts of Spring Security out in this chapter and will also
    detail the Spring WebFlux framework itself. First we will introduce you to Spring
    WebFlux using an example and then we will build on the additional technical capabilities
    on top of the base application.'

    starts off by introducing you to some of the important concepts in regards to
    REST and JWT. It then introduces OAuth concepts and, using hands-on coding examples,
    explains simple and advanced REST API security, focusing on utilizing Spring Security
    and Spring Boot modules in Spring Framework. The examples will use the OAuth protocol
    and will be using Spring Security to the fullest to secure REST APIs. In addition
    to that, JWT will be used to exchange claims between the server and client.'

    considered for use alongside Spring Security. These products are strong contenders
    that can be used to achieve the technical capability that you are looking for
    in your application to cover various security requirements. We will introduce
    a product to you by giving you the gist of the technical capability that needs
    addressing in your application, before taking a look at the product in question
