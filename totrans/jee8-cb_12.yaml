  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: First of all, what is the *Adopt a JSR* program?
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It's an initiative intended to bring the community closer together in the process
    of evolving Java. By *community* we mean **Java User Groups** (**JUGs**), individuals,
    and any other kind of organization.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To understand it, maybe we should hold on for a second and understand the Java
    evolution process.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Java technology is a set of standards called **JSR**, the abbreviation for **Java
    Specification Request**. Every API and any aspects of the language have to be
    written in some JSR.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Every JSR has a spec leader, an individual in charge of leading the process
    of building that specification. Each spec lead works with a group called an **EG**,
    or **Expert Group**, which works with the spec lead and does all the heavy lifting
    of creating and/or evolving a JSR.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In each JSR there are also contributors, people from the community who volunteer
    to collaborate with a JSR. They don't have the same role as the spec leader or
    the EG, but can also do a lot for this process.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For each JSR, there's a **Reference Implementation** (**RI**). The RI is the
    real code that JSR is working as a real Java code. It exists to bring all those
    conceptual lines of a specification to the real world. It's vital for proving
    that what was once specified really works.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Examples of RIs are Mojarra for JSF, Soteria for Security, and GlassFish for
    Java EE.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When we say that the RI is a proof that some JSR really works, this is not just
    some conceptual stuff. It is really tested. That's why we have the **TCKs**, or
    **Technology Compatibility Kits**.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: TCKs are a set of tests designed to test the implementations specified in the
    JSR. So when an RI is written, it should pass in the TCKs to prove that it's really
    working (at least in theory).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Those three parts—the JSR, the RI, and the TCK—are the pieces ratified by the **Java
    Community Process** or **JCP**.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So in the JCP, you have all the working JSRs and their own processes monitored
    by the **Executive Committee** (**EC**), a group formed by companies, individuals,
    and JUGs that guarantee that all JSRs are working under the best practices defined
    by the JCP, and moving towards to the best results for the Java ecosystem and
    the community that relies on it.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'So the next time you think *"how can I contribute to Java?"*, *"how can I make
    my contribution?"* or, more specific to this section, *"how can I adopt a JSR?"*,
    know that you can do it by doing the following:'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    to accepting help with the hard work of evolving a JSR.

    starting a small group in your company, or wherever you can find some people to
    work together. It's a lot of work, so it's better to have some company!

    It's important, but often people involved with writing specification and coding
