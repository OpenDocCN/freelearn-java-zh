    In this chapter, you will learn how to implement a reusable and extensible login
    form that supports multiple languages, and see the advantages of favoring *composition*
    over *extension* when implementing UI components. Through examples, we'll discuss
    why *extension* is not always the best approach, and we'll explore several alternatives
    for implementing custom server-side UI components with Vaadin.

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Let's explore how to implement a login form component. The first idea that comes
    to mind when starting to develop a UI component is to extend, in the Java sense,
    an existing component. Most of the time, the natural choice is to extend a layout
    component such as `VerticalLayout` or `HorizontalLayout`. For example, a login
    form usually includes at least a username field, a password field, a login button,
    and a remember me checkbox, with all of them aligned vertically. So, let's start
    by directly extending `VerticalLayout`.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: What is wrong with the previous implementation? Well, there's nothing inherently
    wrong with it. However, it can be highly improved. The `LoginFormLayout` class
    violates encapsulation! Clients of the class know that a `VerticalLayout` is used.
    All public methods of `VerticalLayout` are exposed to clients of `LoginFormLayout`.
    If, for some reason, the implementation needs to change to a different layout
    (a `FormLayout`, `CssLayout`, or even a `Panel`, for instance), clients calling
    any method in `VerticalLayout` that are not in the new base layout class would
    break.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To the outside world, `LoginFormLayout` is a `Layout`. The purpose of a login
    form is not to serve as a layout (to position other components), but to show the
    fields that are required to authenticate users with the application. So, let's
    try to get more encapsulation into the design!

    any class at all. However, in that case, we wouldn''t get a `Component`, but a

    a more suitable component in the hierarchy? Let''s start with interfaces. The

    components directly extend this class. It''s not a convenient class for the login
    form, though, since it''s too general and doesn''t offer methods to add other
    components to it. `AbstractField` and `AbstractListing` can be discarded as well
    because the login form is not just a field showing a value or a list of values,
    respectively.'

- en: The next candidates are the `AbstractSingleComponentContainer`, `AbstractComponentContainer`,
    and `AbstractLayout` classes. These classes help with the implementation of layouts,
    but as we discussed previously, a login form shouldn't look like a layout to the
    external world.

    to offer functionality to the clients. For example, how would clients of the class
    get the username or password values introduced by the user in the form? One option
    is to implement getters in the factory class, but that would require some more
    adjustments in the `LoginFormFactory` class. At the end of the day, this kind
    of implementation would require you to implement (and maintain) two highly coupled
    classes for a single custom component. Not a very good idea.

    of compositions of components by eliminating some of the problems previously described.
    `Composite` directly extends `AbstractComponent`, which means that any class extending
    `Composite` is a `Component` itself that can be added to any Vaadin layout. A
    `Composite` can specify a composition root that serves as the root of the components

    logic into a separate class that allows clients to add resource bundles and get
    localized strings by name. Encapsulating this logic into a separate class allows
