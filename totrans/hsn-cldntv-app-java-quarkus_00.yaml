- en: Despite its age, Java still remains one of the most popular choices among developers,
    having made it through almost 20 years of constant improvements and having developed
    a full stack of libraries for enterprise systems. As we are living in a fast-paced
    industry, we cannot deny that many things have changed in the last few years with
    the introduction of containers, microservices, reactive applications, and cloud
    platforms. To remain a first-class citizen in this changing world, Java needs
    a boost. And we, at Red Hat, believe that this boost can be Quarkus!

- en: Quarkus has been designed from the ground up to be a Kubernetes-native Java
    framework that is a perfect fit for creating microservice applications with a
    minimal memory footprint and fast execution. At the same time, Quarkus does not
    dump the rich set of libraries, such as Hibernate, and REST services that most
    developers are familiar with. On the contrary, they are part of a larger picture
    that includes the game-changing MicroProfile API, reactive programming models
    such as Vert.x, and a ton of other features that can be easily plugged into your
    services.

- en: Quarkus provides an effective solution for running Java in this new world of
    serverless, microservices, containers, Kubernetes, **Function as a Service** (**FaaS**),
    and the cloud because it has been designed with these in mind. Its container-first
    approach to cloud-native Java applications unifies imperative and reactive programming
    paradigms for microservices development and offers an extensible set of standards-based
    enterprise Java libraries and frameworks combined with extreme developer productivity
    that promises to revolutionize the way we develop in Java.

    in learning about a very promising microservice architecture for building reliable
    and robust applications. Some knowledge of Java, Spring, and REST APIs is assumed.

- en: '[Chapter 1](0e04a6a1-5a50-4557-be00-f4a3406fa1dd.xhtml), *Introduction to Quarkus
    Core Concepts*, explains the container-first (minimal-footprint Java applications
    are optimal for running in containers), cloud-native (Quarkus embraces the 12-factor
    architecture of environments such as Kubernetes), and microservice-first (Quarkus
    brings lightning-fast start up times and code turnaround times to Java apps) approaches.
    We will examine the various tools available for developing Quarkus applications.
    For this, we will install an IDE and GraalVM, which is required for native applications.'

    Application with Quarkus*, takes you through building your first application with
    Quarkus. We will see how to use Maven/Gradle plugins to bootstrap your application.
    You will learn how to import the application in your IDS, and how to run and test
    the application. Next, we will discuss creating a native application from your
    Java project.'

    how to run an application on Docker, how to install a single-node cluster of OpenShift,
    and how to run an application on Minishift.'

    CDI stack and a web frontend. We will see how to deploy the application and see
    changes without restarting Quarkus.'

    persistence to the customer store example as well as setting up a database (PostgreSQL)
    to run the example. We will then take the application to the cloud. Finally, we
    will show you how Hibernate Panache can simplify application development.'
