- en: In the evolving landscape of Java concurrency, the role of threads takes center
    stage, influencing the performance and responsiveness of our applications. With
    the release of version 21, the Java platform introduces a groundbreaking paradigm
    shift – the coexistence of two distinct thread types, platform threads and the
    revolutionary virtual threads.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Traditionally, every instance of `java.lang.Thread` in the JDK has been a platform
    thread. This thread type runs Java code on an underlying OS thread, monopolizing
    that thread for the entirety of the code’s execution. The number of platform threads
    is limited by the number of available OS threads, leading to potential bottlenecks
    in resource utilization.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Virtual threads mark a paradigmatic shift in the concurrency landscape. Unlike
    their platform counterparts, virtual threads run Java code on an underlying OS
    thread without capturing it for the code’s entire lifetime. It means that multiple
    virtual threads can efficiently share the same OS thread, offering a lightweight
    and scalable approach to concurrency. In contrast to the limited number of platform
    threads, the flexibility of virtual threads allows for a much larger pool, making
    them a powerful tool for optimizing resource usage.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Virtual threads introduce the *M:N* scheduling concept, a departure from the
    traditional *1:1* scheduling of platform threads. In this new paradigm, a substantial
    number (*M*) of virtual threads can be scheduled to run on a smaller number (*N*)
    of OS threads. This approach mirrors the success of user-mode threads in other
    languages, such as goroutines in Go and processes in Erlang. It harks back to
    Java’s early days when green threads, albeit sharing a single OS thread, laid
    the foundation for what would later become the virtual threads we have today.

    threads and virtual threads becomes pivotal. The efficiency gains and scalability
    offered by virtual threads are transformative, especially in scenarios where resource
    optimization is paramount. Whether you’re orchestrating complex concurrent operations
    or aiming for more responsive applications, understanding the nuances of these
    thread types equips you to make informed choices.
