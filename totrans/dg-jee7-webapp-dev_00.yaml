- en: This is a book about the Java EE 7 platform and web digital development, and
    it is a continuation of the first book *Java EE 7 Developer Handbook*. The entire
    focus of this tome is the space and software architecture between the frontend
    technologies and business logic tier. While there was a lack of printing space
    and working balance between life and time for this subject in my first book, in
    this book *Digital Java EE 7*, there is plenty of effort and determination to
    write exclusively about the Java *presentation tier*. This book was written for
    the developers who want to become superior and adept at building a web application
    on JVM with the standard Java EE 7 platform.

- en: This book mostly covers the presentation tier from the Java standard's point
    of view. Therefore, there are entire chapters dedicated to JavaServer Faces as
    it is the most important and oldest dedicated web framework on the Java EE 7 platform.
    Even though the technology has been around since 2004, there are commercial organizations
    and businesses around the world that rely on JSF. They range from blue-chip companies
    to well-respected investment banks. Yet, with the Java EE 7 release, JSF 2.2 has
    several key features that web developers will enjoy and find incredibly helpful
    such as the HTML5 friendly markup support and Faces Flow.

- en: As a reader, it is my hope that you will become enlightened on the path to build
    software that enables you to stride up the mountainous paths of the contemporary
    Java web technology and that you will gain the qualification of an accomplished
    master (or mistress) in your mind.

    to its concepts. We will progress to the building of the JSF input forms and learn
    how to validate their input in several ways. The most important task of developing
    Create Retrieve Update and Delete (CRUD) for JSF web applications will hit the
    nail squarely on the head. Afterwards, we will add more style and finesse to the
    JSF applications. On the way, we will write applications that validate with AJAX
    for an immediate effect. We will continue our adventure into the elegant world
    of conversational scope backing bean controllers. We will find that these are
    handy little things that we will map together and capture our stakeholders' customer
    journeys. Finally, we will learn about Faces Flows, which are a standout addition
    in JSF 2.2.

- en: No Java web technology book would be complete without telling the reader about
    the JavaScript programming language and emerging technologies. Many senior Java
    engineers would agree that Java on the Web has—to some degree—conceded ground
    on the presentation tier to the JavaScript client-side frameworks. Building REST/UI
    frontend applications are now so common that it is difficult for the so-called
    digital Java engineer to ignore the influence of jQuery, RequireJS, and others.
    There are several known JavaScript frameworks out there in the wild. In this book,
    we will cover AngularJS. We will step into the middle of that blustery windy bridge
    in between the two major landscapes of Java, JVM, and JavaScript. I can't promise
    you that it will not be scary, but you might find yourself pleasantly surprised
    by the way that you will stand comfortably and negotiate the ledges and handholds
    between both the JAX-RS services and AngularJS controllers.

    We dedicate an entire single chapter to the upcoming Java EE 8 Model-View-Controller,
    which may become an alternative sizzling emerald in the way we build future REST/UI
    applications. Beyond this book's finish line, we have put together three essential
    appendices that I hope will act as excellent reference material.

- en: At the end of each chapter, we have dedicated a special section to educational
    exercises, which I hope you find relevant and decent, and you have fun learning
    while your thought processes are being conveniently stretched. This was written
    for you, the Java web developer on a mission to innovate. Enjoy!

    You should already know about classes, inheritance, and Java Collections. Therefore,
    this book is pitched at intermediate Java developers. You may have 1-2 years of
    experience in Java SE core development. You should have an understanding of the
    core Java EE platform, although an in-depth knowledge is not strictly required.
    You should be comfortable with Java persistence, Java servlets, and deployment
    of the WAR files to an application server such as GlassFish or WildFly or an equivalent
    server.
