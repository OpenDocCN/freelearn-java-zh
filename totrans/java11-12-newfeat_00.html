            <article>
                
<p>There are a number of text conventions used throughout this book.</p>
<p><kbd>CodeInText</kbd>: <span>Indicates c</span>ode words in text, database table names, folder names, filenames, file extensions, pathnames, dummy URLs, user input, and Twitter handles. <span>Here is an example:</span> "The <kbd>PUT</kbd> request is used to create or update an entity on a server, using a URI."</p>
<p>A block of code is set as follows:</p>
<pre>class GarmentFactory { <br/>    void createShirts() { <br/>        Shirt redShirtS = new Shirt(Size.SMALL, Color.red); </pre>
<p>When we wish to draw your attention to a particular part of a code block, the relevant lines or items are set in bold:</p>
<pre><strong>abstract</strong> record JVMLanguage(String name, int year); <br/>record Conference(String name, String venue, DateTime when); </pre>
<p>Any command-line input or output is written as follows:</p>
<pre>  <strong>java -Xshare:dump </strong>  </pre>
<p><strong>Bold</strong>: Indicates a new term, an important word, or w<span>ords that you see on screen. For example, words in menus or dialog boxes appear in the text like this. Here is an example: "As you will notice, the <span class="packt_screen">Lock Instances</span> option displays an exclamation mark right next to it.</span><span>"</span></p>
<div class="packt_infobox">Warnings or important notes appear like this.</div>
<div class="packt_tip">Tips and tricks appear like this.</div>
