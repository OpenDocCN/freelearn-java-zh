    interact with social media to promote our products and complex systems, to provide
    great value for our users.

    With the birth of Spring Boot and the democratization of cloud platforms, we can
    now create amazing applications and make them available to everyone in record
    time, without spending a penny.

    with a lot of neat features, such as internationalization, form validation, distributed
    sessions and caches, social login, multithreaded programming, and many more.
