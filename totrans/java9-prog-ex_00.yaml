- en: Java drastically changed with the introduction of Java 8, and this change has
    been elevated to a whole new level with the new version, Java 9\. Java has a well-established
    past, being more than 20 years old, but at the same time, it is new, functional,
    reactive, and sexy. This is a language that developers love, and at the same time,
    it is the number one choice of developer language for many enterprise projects.

- en: It is probably more lucrative to learn Java now than ever before, starting with
    Java 9\. We encourage you to start your professional developer career by learning
    Java 9, and we have done our best in this book to help you along this road. We
    assembled the topics of the book so that it is easy to start, and you can feel
    the things working and moving very soon. At the same time, we have tried to reach
    very far, signaling the road ahead for a professional developer.

- en: I could very well see why writing side-effect-free code worked! I was hooked and started
    playing with Scala, Clojure, and Erlang. Immutability was the norm here.

    and started learning about it.

    structure is created. The strategy of copy and write with maximized sharing was
    an intriguing one! All that careful synchronization is simply not needed!
  prefs: []

- en: The languages come equipped with garbage collection. So, if a version is not
    needed anymore, runtime would take care of reclaiming the memory.
  prefs: []

- en: All in good time, though! Reading this book will help you see that we need not
    sacrifice algorithmic performance while avoiding in-place mutation!

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To immerse into the content of this book and to soak up most of the skills and
    knowledge, we assume that you already have some experience with programming. We
    do not assume too much but hope that you already know what a variable is, that
    computers have memory, disk, network interfaces, and what they generally are.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In addition to these basic skills, there are some technical requirements to
    try out the code and the examples of the book. You need a computer—something that
    is available today and can run Windows, Linux, or OSX. You need an operating system
    and, probably, that is all you need to pay for. All other tools and services that
    you will need are available as open source and free of charge. Some of them are
    also available as commercial products with an extended feature set, but for the
    scope of this book, starting to learn Java 9 programming, those features are not
    needed. Java, a development environment, build tools, and all other software components
    we use are open source.
