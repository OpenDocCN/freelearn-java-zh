<p class="mce-root">Today's Scala is quite different from its earlier versions.</p>
<p class="mce-root">The second version of the language is more than twelve years old, and underwent multiple changes related to supported features and library implementation. Many features then considered crucial, such as support for XML literals, Swing, and Actors, were moved from the language core to the external libraries or replaced by open source alternatives. Another functionality that makes Scala the programming language as we know it today were added directly, or by including yet another open source library in the distribution. The most notable example is adopting Akka in version 2.10.</p>
<p class="mce-root">Scala 2.13, with its focus on modularizing standard libraries and simplifying collections, entails a further change. The changes, however, do not only affect the technical side of Scala. Years of using it to solve real problems have helped us to collect more knowledge about structuring functional programs and using object-oriented features in new ways to our advantage. The same way as it was customary to use earlier versions of Scala as "Java without semicolons<span>,</span>" it is now routine to build programs using monad transformers and type-level programming techniques.</p>
<p class="mce-root">This book addresses both technical and architectural changes by providing a comprehensive guide to the redesigned standard library and collections, as well as covering type systems and first-level support for functions <span>in depth</span>. It discusses implicits as a primary mechanism for building type classes and looks at different ways of testing Scala code. It covers in detail abstract building blocks used in functional programming, affording sufficient knowledge to pick up and use any existing functional programming library out there. It explores reactive programming by covering the Akka framework and reactive streams. Finally, it talks about microservices and how to implement them with Scala and the Lagom framework.</p>

<p>As a software developer, you have a working knowledge of some imperative programming language, presumably Java.</p>
<p>You've got some basic Scala knowledge and a bit of experience of using it in actual projects. As a Scala beginner, you are surprised by the richness of its ecosystem, and the multiplicity of ways in which it allows you to solve problems, as well as the number of libraries <span>available</span>. You want to improve your Scala skills to be able to fully utilize the potential of the language and its reworked standard library, optimally use its rich type system to formulate your programs as closely as possible to the problem domain, and profit from its functional capabilities by understanding underlying paradigms, using relevant language features and open source libraries.</p>

<li><span>We expect the reader to be comfortable with structuring and implementing simple programs in Scala and familiar with SBT and REPL. No previous knowledge of reactive programming, Akka, or microservices is required, but familiarity with the underlying concepts would be beneficial.</span></li>
<li>To work with the code examples in this book, Java 1.8+ and SBT 1.2+ need to be installed. The installation of Git is recommended to simplify checking out the source code from GitHub. For those readers who don't have the prerequisite software ready, we provide installation instructions for Java and SBT in Appendix A.</li>

<p>There are a number of text conventions used throughout this book.</p>
<p><kbd>CodeInText</kbd>: <span>Indicates c</span>ode words in text, database table names, folder names, filenames, file extensions, pathnames, dummy URLs, user input, and Twitter handles. <span>Here is an example:</span> "<span>In Scala 2.13, </span><kbd>StringOps</kbd><span> has been extended with option-returning methods for string literals parsing. Supported types include all numeric types and </span><kbd>Boolean</kbd>."</p>
<p>A block of code is set as follows:</p>
<pre><span>object </span>UserDb {<br/>  <span>def </span><span>getById</span>(id: <span>Long</span>): User = <span>???<br/></span><span>  </span><span>def </span><span>update</span>(u: User): User = <span>???<br/></span><span>  </span><span>def </span><span>save</span>(u: User): <span>Boolean </span>= <span>???<br/></span>}</pre>
<p>When we wish to draw your attention to a particular part of a code block, the relevant lines or items are set in bold:</p>
<pre>scala&gt; val user = User("John", "Doe", "jd@mail.me")<br/><strong>user: User = User(John,Doe,jd@mail.me)</strong><br/>scala&gt; naiveToJsonString(user)<br/><strong>res1: String = { "name": "John", "surname": "Doe", "email": "jd@mail.me" }</strong></pre>
<p>Any command-line input or output is written as follows:</p>
<pre><strong>take</strong><br/><strong>-S--c--a--l--a-- --2--.--1--3-</strong><br/><strong>take</strong><br/><strong>Lazy view constructed: -S-S-c-C-a-A-l-L-a-A- - </strong><br/><strong>Lazy view forced: -S--c--a--l--a-- -List(S, C, A, L, A, )</strong><br/><strong>Strict: List(S, C, A, L, A, )</strong></pre>
<p><strong>Bold</strong>: Indicates a new term, an important word, or w<span>ords that you see on screen.</span></p>
