			<h1 id="_idParaDest-6"><a id="_idTextAnchor006"/>Preface</h1>
			<p>In 1980, after being married for just a few months, I purchased my first computer. Why? Because at the age of 26, I thought it could be the best toy I could ever own. It was an Apple ][+. Within days of its arrival, I became obsessed with it. In the late 70s and early 80s, numerous magazines were dedicated to the new realm of personal computers and I bought most of them. I’d come home from work when I was a photography technician at Dawson College and typed in any program I could find. Three years later, I left Dawson and struck out on my own programming professionally, and seven years after that, I became a college instructor in computer science at <span class="No-Break">Dawson College.</span></p>
			<p>I mention this story because computer programming changed my life. Every day I woke up, and to this day, I still wake up to face new challenges and problems that I need to solve. You are likely a programmer for the <span class="No-Break">same reason.</span></p>
			<p>Few, if any, developers spend their career only programming in a single language or on a single operating system. This is why I wrote this book. If you already code in one language, you already know the basics of almost every programming language. This is not a book on programming for beginners. It is a book for beginners to <span class="No-Break">Java programming.</span></p>
			<p>The four parts of this book present the skills you need to be familiar with to be a successful Java programmer. Java is a language that is experiencing rapid evolution. This book covers the recent enhancements to the language for both desktop and <span class="No-Break">server-side programming.</span></p>
			<p>In this book, I present source code that is just as important to read as the text of the book. All the source code is available on GitHub. For this book to have its full impact, I ask that you download all the examples. Run the examples and enhance them. Much of what I have learned has come from working with code samples. I describe what I do with these samples as conducting experiments. I encourage you to conduct your own experiments with the <span class="No-Break">sample code.</span></p>
			<p>While I do briefly discuss <strong class="bold">Integrated Development Environments</strong> (<strong class="bold">IDEs</strong>), all the examples can be edited with a simple text editor and then run either directly from the command line or with the Maven build tool. If you already have a favorite IDE or plan to use one, know that all the code built for Maven will load into any IDE without needing you to <span class="No-Break">change anything.</span></p>
			<p>Java has been around for 27 years at the time of writing. Whenever it has been declared out of date, too verbose, or too complex, the Java community has contributed new ideas, syntax, and libraries that have become part of the language. I could write for pages and pages on how Java has changed since its introduction in 1996. I won’t, but what I do wish to impress on you is that Java is a language you are always learning. This book is just a <span class="No-Break">starting point.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-7"><a id="_idTextAnchor007"/>Who this book is for</h1>
			<p>This book has been written for developers with experience with languages other than Java. It is assumed that you have worked with one or more languages in the last few years. Recently you had either been assigned a new or existing Java project, yet that is not your background. Or maybe you just want to add to your resume. Think of this book as a beginner’s book for <span class="No-Break">experienced developers.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-8"><a id="_idTextAnchor008"/>What this book covers</h1>
			<p><a href="B19088_01.xhtml#_idTextAnchor017"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 1</em></span></a>, <em class="italic">Understanding Java Distributions</em>, presents a little history of the language, followed by how Java is distributed, downloaded, and installed for Windows, Linux, <span class="No-Break">and macOS.</span></p>
			<p><a href="B19088_02.xhtml#_idTextAnchor043"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 2</em></span></a>, <em class="italic">Code, Compile, and Execute</em>, prepares you to code, compile, and execute your first program. An IDE is not required, and you just need a text editor, and the latest version of Java installed on <span class="No-Break">your PC.</span></p>
			<p><a href="B19088_03.xhtml#_idTextAnchor062"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 3</em></span></a>, <em class="italic">The Maven Build Tool</em>, shows you how to manage programs that can consist of many files along with dependencies on external libraries is the purview of the Maven <span class="No-Break">build tool.</span></p>
			<p><a href="B19088_04.xhtml#_idTextAnchor086"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 4</em></span></a>, <em class="italic">Language Fundamentals – Data Types and Variables</em>, provides an introduction to what data types are available in Java and the operations we can perform <span class="No-Break">on them.</span></p>
			<p><a href="B19088_05.xhtml#_idTextAnchor106"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 5</em></span></a>, <em class="italic">Language Fundamentals – Classes</em>, introduces object-oriented programming as carried out in Java and revolves around the structure called <span class="No-Break">a class.</span></p>
			<p><a href="B19088_06.xhtml#_idTextAnchor128"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 6</em></span></a>, <em class="italic">Methods, Interfaces, Records, and Their Relationships</em>, examines the structures in which Java code is written. You will learn that classes have an interface, the public members of the class. An interface class enforces an interface, while a record represents an immutable data class. The relationships between classes <span class="No-Break">are described.</span></p>
			<p><a href="B19088_07.xhtml#_idTextAnchor154"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 7</em></span></a>, <em class="italic">Java Syntax and Exceptions</em>, introduces you to the low-level syntax of Java employed in methods, and what happens when things go wrong, an exception <span class="No-Break">is thrown.</span></p>
			<p><a href="B19088_08.xhtml#_idTextAnchor172"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 8</em></span></a>, <em class="italic">Arrays, Collections, Generics, Functions, and Streams</em>, examines how we process multiple data elements in Java using arrays and collections. Generics enhance type safety, functions enhance the processing of elements, and streams provide an alternative to loops for processing <span class="No-Break">multiple items.</span></p>
			<p><a href="B19088_09.xhtml#_idTextAnchor195"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 9</em></span></a>, <em class="italic">Using Threads in Java</em>, introduces you to one of Java’s greatest strengths, its inherent support of threads. The new threading approach called virtual threads is <span class="No-Break">also examined.</span></p>
			<p><a href="B19088_10.xhtml#_idTextAnchor214"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 10</em></span></a>, <em class="italic">Implementing Software Design Principles and Patterns in Java</em>, presents software design principles that provide guidance on how you construct your classes and how your objects <span class="No-Break">should interact.</span></p>
			<p><a href="B19088_11.xhtml#_idTextAnchor232"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 11</em></span></a>, <em class="italic">Documentation and Logging</em>, presents how you can document what a program does in the source code. Information about a program is shown while it is running <span class="No-Break">using logging.</span></p>
			<p><a href="B19088_12.xhtml#_idTextAnchor244"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 12</em></span></a>, <em class="italic">BigDecimal and Unit Testing</em>, demonstrates that when the accuracy of calculations, typically for currency, is required, then BigDecimal is the answer. Determining whether your program is delivering the correct results is the role of <span class="No-Break">unit testing.</span></p>
			<p><a href="B19088_13.xhtml#_idTextAnchor254"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 13</em></span></a>, <em class="italic">Desktop Graphical User Interface Coding with Swing and JavaFX</em>, presents the two Java <strong class="bold">graphical user interface</strong> (<strong class="bold">GUI</strong>) libraries, Swing and JavaFX, which support GUIs. You will see the same business logic presented using <span class="No-Break">each library.</span></p>
			<p><a href="B19088_14.xhtml#_idTextAnchor281"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 14</em></span></a>, <em class="italic">Server-Side Coding with Jakarta</em>, introduces you to backend web programming in Java. You will set up your application server and deploy Java code in the format of <span class="No-Break">a servlet.</span></p>
			<p><a href="B19088_15.xhtml#_idTextAnchor301"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 15</em></span></a>, <em class="italic">Jakarta Faces Application</em>, introduces you to server-side rendering of web pages. The application from <a href="B19088_13.xhtml#_idTextAnchor254"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 13</em></span></a>, <em class="italic">Desktop Graphical User Interface Coding with Swing and JavaFX</em>, will now be presented as a <span class="No-Break">Faces application.</span></p>
			<p><a href="B19088_16.xhtml#_idTextAnchor315"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 16</em></span></a>, <em class="italic">Deploying Java in Standalone Packages and Containers</em>, shows we can distribute our applications. You will see how we can create installers for desktop programs and Docker containers for web applications commonly used for <span class="No-Break">cloud deployment.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-9"><a id="_idTextAnchor009"/>To get the most out of this book</h1>
			<p>There is just one assumption I have for you, and it is that you have a few years of experience working in any imperative language. If you are unsure what this means, then consider that JavaScript is an imperative language while HTML is a declarative language. Experience with an object-oriented, imperative language such as C# or C++ could be helpful but is <span class="No-Break">not required.</span></p>
			<p>At the time of this writing, Java 17 was the <strong class="bold">long-term support</strong> (<strong class="bold">LTS</strong>) version. All the code in this book will work in Java 17 and all subsequent versions. Versions prior to Java 17 may <span class="No-Break">not work.</span></p>
