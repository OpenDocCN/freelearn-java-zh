- en: WildFly, the newest release of the JBoss Application Server, provides developers
    with a full implementation of the Java EE 7 platform. It is built on solid foundations
    of the modular architecture introduced with JBoss AS 7, but it has grown in terms
    of flexibility and performance. The newest version of the Enterprise Java focuses
    on developers' productivity, and so does WildFly.

- en: This book will introduce Java developers to the world of enterprise applications.
    We will use modern development techniques and tools that are battle-tested in
    real-life projects. We'll also utilize the features provided by the WildFly platform,
    such as security, caching, testing, and clustering. Finally, you will learn how
    to manage your server using dedicated tools, created specifically for WildFly.

    which is a sample project that will get more features (and sometimes completely
    different user interfaces) with every chapter.
