The chapter will also look at some of the more advanced techniques that are available for developers. This chapter will cover the following topics:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Basic development</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Additional tools</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Project management and feedback</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Other resources</li></ul></div><div class="section" title="Basic development"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch10lvl1sec52"/>Basic development</h1></div></div></div><p>In this book, we have <a id="id551" class="indexterm"/>looked at many different ways of performing image processing and analysis. Automation using macros and plugins were introduced, allowing for infinite possibilities in processing and analysis. The topics in this book have been written for users who would like to start developing their own plugins and macros. Naturally, this book can only provide so much information within its pages, so this section is meant to provide some handles on how to proceed further along this path.</p><p>To start with, creating macros and plugins gets easier with repeated practice and learning from previous code (or other people's code). When creating macros, it is a good practice to make small macros that perform only a single step in processing. Then, by combining multiple macros, you can create a very versatile toolbox. Many useful tools in ImageJ, such as the ActionBar plugin, allow you to create a fast way to launch many different macros in succession. When developing in this fashion, make sure that you create macros that can be daisy-chained. The output of one macro can be used as input to the next macro and so on. This method will save you a lot of time, and it allows for almost any combination you wish to create.</p><p>For plugins, a similar advice holds. When you use a specific function many times over, it may be worth it to create a standalone class with helpful tools that you use often. By instantiating the class to gain access to its methods, you can reuse your code in many different projects. Some of the larger ImageJ projects use a specific tool class or classes. For instance, MtrackJ and NeuronJ both use a library of methods called <code class="literal">imagescience.jar</code>. When making plugins with an interface, it is also a good idea to build your actual processing or analysis routines in separate classes, which can easily be swapped when you develop new or better techniques.</p><p>There are many good resources available online to develop macros used in image processing and analysis. The most basic one is the repository on the ImageJ website, which contains many <a id="id552" class="indexterm"/>excellent macros that perform basic and more advanced tasks and can be found at <a class="ulink" href="http://imagej.nih.gov/ij/macros/">http://imagej.nih.gov/ij/macros/</a>. Another good resource is the Fiji website, which contains a lot of information about image processing and analysis <a id="id553" class="indexterm"/>described in a cookbook (<a class="ulink" href="http://imagej.net/Cookbook">http://imagej.net/Cookbook</a>). This cookbook is based on the defunct MBF microscopy resources and explains how to process and analyze specific images using the tools supplied with Fiji.</p><p>Some very good resources have been published as well. <span class="emphasis"><em>Digital Image Processing</em></span> by <span class="emphasis"><em>Burger and Burge</em></span> is a comprehensive textbook that focuses on the algorithms used by ImageJ functions. This provides <a id="id554" class="indexterm"/>a mathematical background to some of the processing functions in ImageJ as well as image transformations and interpolations. Examples in their work are based on or extracted from ImageJ source code. Another good resource is Gonzalez and Woods' <span class="emphasis"><em>Digital Image Processing</em></span>, which uses MATLAB for image-processing examples. It, however, also provides a mathematical background as well as techniques such as fuzzy logic in image processing. Many of the examples used can be translated to ImageJ as an exercise. A good source for algorithms is the <span class="emphasis"><em>Numerical recipes</em></span> book series, which was written in the C/C++ language. Many of the algorithms can be translated into Java without too much hassle. Another resource that can help in understanding the physics of image formation, as well as the basics of signal <a id="id555" class="indexterm"/>processing, is <span class="emphasis"><em>The Scientist and Engineer's Guide to Digital Signal Processing</em></span> by Steven Smith (available on <a class="ulink" href="http://www.dspguide.com/">http://www.dspguide.com/</a>).</p><p>Finally, if you wish to develop plugins that utilize a user interface, it is a good idea to look at many different plugins with interfaces. In <a class="link" href="ch08.html" title="Chapter 8. Anatomy of ImageJ Plugins">Chapter 8</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Anatomy of ImageJ Plugins</em></span> we looked at different examples of plugins with a basic and advanced interface. Some of these examples have a very clear and intuitive interface that can be used with minimal documentation. There are many good publications on good designs of interfaces as well as online resources that can show you examples of good and bad designs. Examples of published books include <span class="emphasis"><em>Universal Principles of Design</em></span>, which examines common concepts in design based on experience and psychological knowledge. Another good resource is the book <span class="emphasis"><em>Don't make me think, revisited</em></span>, which is written with web design in mind. However, the core principles are the same for desktop applications and ImageJ plugins.</p><p>Another good online resource is the blog of Joel Spolsky, a developer involved with Microsoft Excel, at <a class="ulink" href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/uibook/chapters/fog0000000057.html">http://www.joelonsoftware.com/uibook/chapters/fog0000000057.html</a>. Although the examples <a id="id556" class="indexterm"/>mentioned are slightly historic, the general truth behind the observations still holds true. It also has a lot of useful insights into designing and running projects.</p><p>To learn more about plugin development in the new ImageJ2 framework, there is good documentation and background <a id="id557" class="indexterm"/>available on the Fiji website on the framework (<a class="ulink" href="http://fiji.sc/ImageJ2">http://fiji.sc/ImageJ2</a>) and some of the library functions such as ImgLib2 (<a class="ulink" href="http://fiji.sc/ImgLib2">http://fiji.sc/ImgLib2</a>). There is also a good collection of example projects available to test and discover how to use these concepts, for instance, how to work with images using <a id="id558" class="indexterm"/>ImgLib2 (<a class="ulink" href="http://fiji.sc/ImgLib2_Examples">http://fiji.sc/ImgLib2_Examples</a>). A set of ImageJ tutorials is available on GitHub as well. They <a id="id559" class="indexterm"/>can be cloned using your favorite Git implementation from <a class="ulink" href="https://GitHub.com/imagej/imagej-tutorials/">https://GitHub.com/imagej/imagej-tutorials/</a>. As ImageJ2 is still under active development and currently is at release candidate status, many changes will still be implemented before it is released as a final version.</p></div></div>
<div class="section" title="Additional tools"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch10lvl1sec53"/>Additional tools</h1></div></div></div><p>Many of the examples <a id="id560" class="indexterm"/>described in this book can be designed and built using the built-in editors of ImageJ and Fiji, but if you want to develop more advanced plugins, setting up an IDE would make you work faster. As a learning tool, an IDE might not be the best <a id="id561" class="indexterm"/>option. The learning curve of the IDE itself can be steep, and also, it can make you lazy. IDEs can be quite clever and analyze your code to provide automatic importing of classes, implementing the required methods, and variable checking and casting. These tools are handy, but it is important to understand what is happening when the IDE suggests these options. Of course, the spellchecking and completion of variable names makes sure that you will make fewer typos, but you should never blindly rely on it. The analysis of code can be quite sophisticated, but it cannot predict what the developer has in mind. This can sometimes result in very odd behavior or errors that may be hard to debug.</p><p>To work with an IDE such as NetBeans, as described in the previous chapters, many resources are available <a id="id562" class="indexterm"/>from the developers of the software. Tutorials for NetBeans can be found at <a class="ulink" href="https://netbeans.org/kb/index.html">https://netbeans.org/kb/index.html</a>, which contains tutorials, examples, and videos to use the IDE to develop projects. Packt Publishing also has books about NetBeans IDE usage, specifically <span class="emphasis"><em>NetBeans IDE 8 cookbook</em></span> and <span class="emphasis"><em>Mastering NetBeans</em></span>.</p><p>Besides investing time in an IDE, it is also helpful to invest time in understanding and learning how to use a revision system, such as Git. The workflow when using a revision system is a little different than when just developing code directly. A revision system would only work if you commit your changes on a regular basis and provide useful commit messages. If you are the only developer on a project, you would not run into many problems such as difficult code mergers and conflicts, so the process becomes relatively straightforward. With the help of a graphical frontend for Git, the whole process becomes manageable and accessible, even for beginners.</p><p>Make sure you are comfortable with using Git before you start a multideveloper project. Conflicts and mergers can get complicated and resolving them may become hard if binary files are involved. Many IDEs have a revision system built in (many times, it's under the <span class="strong"><strong>Team</strong></span> menu, that is, in Eclipse and NetBeans). Whether you use the built-in system or a standalone interface, there are a few good resources to look at before using them. They will help in <a id="id563" class="indexterm"/>understanding what the system is capable of (and what not). A very good <a id="id564" class="indexterm"/>resource is the <span class="emphasis"><em>Git Book</em></span>, which can be downloaded from <a class="ulink" href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2">https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2</a>, while printed copies are also available. <a class="link" href="ch02.html" title="Chapter 2. Basic Image Processing with ImageJ">Chapter 2</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Basic Image Processing with ImageJ</em></span> and <a class="link" href="ch03.html" title="Chapter 3. Advanced Image Processing with ImageJ">Chapter 3</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Advanced Image Processing with ImageJ</em></span> give a clear <a id="id565" class="indexterm"/>overview of how to use Git in daily life. It mostly uses the command-line interface for the examples. However, the graphical frontends that are available use the same terminology. Packt Publishing has practical books for working with Git as well, including <span class="emphasis"><em>Git Version Control cookbook</em></span> and <span class="emphasis"><em>Git: Version Control for Everyone</em></span>, which contain practical examples and use cases for development.</p><p>For Subversion, another revision <a id="id566" class="indexterm"/>software package, a similar online resource is available at <a class="ulink" href="http://svnbook.red-bean.com/en/1.7/index.html">http://svnbook.red-bean.com/en/1.7/index.html</a>. It details the basis of subversion and explains the process of committing changes and the revision process. This resource also assumes a mostly command-line approach to dealing with the repository system, but the terminology is similar to most graphical frontends. Most clients that are compatible with Git also support Subversion, and there are packages available that can convert a Subversion repository into a Git repository without (too much) loss of the structure of the repository. One graphical frontend that I use on a regular basis is SmartGit/Hg by Syntevo. It runs on all platforms and has support for GitHub repositories. It is free for non-commercial work, but requires a license when used for commercial projects.</p></div>
<div class="section" title="Project management and feedback"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch10lvl1sec54"/>Project management and feedback</h1></div></div></div><p>There are a few <a id="id567" class="indexterm"/>difficulties that come with working with a team on a project. Such work requires an additional layer on top of the actual development. For this, there are project-management solutions available that can organize projects. These solutions usually contain multiple levels and are usually built on top or on part of a revision system. Most project-management solutions contain (at least) issue trackers and road maps. Most of these solutions are mostly built as administrative tools and do not directly interface with the developed code (at least in the case of ImageJ plugins). They, however, allow for developers to keep track of progress and plan future development and for end users to provide feedback and indicate where bugs and errors exist. Most of these solutions run on a server that can be approached via a browser, and they support multiple users as well as unregistered guest users.</p><p>Different solutions exist, and the choice for a solution should be based on your needs and equipment available. Server hosting nowadays is not really complicated or expensive, so the choices are quite broad. Some options are available are GitHub. They can host projects, provided they are open source, for free. Other options are hosting your own solution, such as Redmine. Redmine is an open source project management solution written in the Ruby language. Other open source examples are Launchpad, used by many Canonical projects related to Ubuntu and Trac used by NASA's JPL and for Tor development. Besides bug trackers, they also have some form of time management and road map. They also allow us to host files and documentation. Redmine also supports news and forum pages for projects, as well as user management on a project basis.</p><p>If you wish to develop code in a more managed setting, these tools may be useful to investigate. Many of these systems can work on a small network or even just on your local computer. To use <a id="id568" class="indexterm"/>any of these systems in a more accessible setting, you require a computer system with a revision system installed, such as Git or Subversion, and a functional and configured webserver application, such as Apache, Nginx, or Tomcat. For Redmine, a Ruby, and a *SQL database installation is also required. Some systems also require a PHP installation for certain functionality. Although this may sound complicated, many of these functionalities come standard <a id="id569" class="indexterm"/>with a <span class="strong"><strong>LAMP</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong>Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP</strong></span>) server distribution, such as the Ubuntu Server edition. Many server-hosting companies provide a fully configured LAMP server without additional management. Also, many of these project-management suites come with simple installers that are configurable for many different use cases.</p><p>Using the software is done via a basic login page, which allows different users with different levels of access to the management system. Privileges can be granted to allow certain users to create, modify, and manage projects. Other users can be added as reporters. They can access most parts of the management systems, such as the trackers and the forum pages, but not the settings of the project. In the case of Redmine, most of the pages are based on a Wiki-like syntax for the content, allowing rich and feature-rich documentation with graphics and other layout options. Most issue trackers have room for different categories, such as bugs, features, or support. This allows us to make classifications of the type of issue that is being reported as well as their priority. Issues can also be assigned to specific developers, making the division of labor for multiple developers clear and easy.</p><p>Resources and documentation for Redmine is available online at <a class="ulink" href="http://www.redmine.org/projects/redmine/wiki/Guide">http://www.redmine.org/projects/redmine/wiki/Guide</a>, which uses Redmine itself and functions as a clear example of the workflow. A published book called <span class="emphasis"><em>Mastering Redmine</em></span> is available as well.</p></div>
<div class="section" title="Other resources"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch10lvl1sec55"/>Other resources</h1></div></div></div><p>When developing code, it <a id="id570" class="indexterm"/>can be useful to check whether certain solutions to your problem already exist. When a good implementation already exists and is used, it saves you time in developing a library or functions. For example, many good solutions to generate Excel files exist in the form of libraries written in Java. One such example is the Apache POI project, which allows for the reading and writing of Excel files (and other Microsoft Office products). Implementations of this library exist for many software packages as well as other Java-based software. For instance, the xlwrite wrapper function <a id="id571" class="indexterm"/>developed for Matlab by Alec de Zegher uses the Apache POI project to create Excel files (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/38591">http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/38591</a>). It should not to be confused with the <code class="literal">.xlswrite</code> wrapper function supplied by MATLAB, which uses ActiveX to write Excel files, thereby requiring a Windows platform.</p><p>For resources that you wish to use as libraries, you can use Maven, as described in <a class="link" href="ch07.html" title="Chapter 7. Explanation of ImageJ Constructs">Chapter 7</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Explanation of ImageJ Constructs</em></span>. Maven is part of most IDE installations (either as part of the core or as a separate plugin). By including the libraries as dependencies in the <code class="literal">&lt;dependencies&gt;</code> tag of the POM model, they will automatically be added to your projects' dependencies list. Additional resources on how to <a id="id572" class="indexterm"/>use Maven in a project can be found on the Apache Maven website (<a class="ulink" href="https://maven.apache.org/guides/index.html">https://maven.apache.org/guides/index.html</a>), which is the main developer of the Maven system. There are also some books and videos available to set up and develop software using Maven, for instance, <span class="emphasis"><em>Apache Maven 3.0 cookbook</em></span> and <span class="emphasis"><em>Maven: The definitive guide</em></span>.</p></div>
