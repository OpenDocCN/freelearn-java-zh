- en: When I started writing this book, I looked back at my experience in architecting
    and developing data engineering solutions, delivering and running those solutions
    effectively in production, and helping many companies to build and manage scalable
    and robust data pipelines and asked myself – *What are the most useful things
    that I can share to help an aspiring or beginner data architect, a data engineer,
    or a Java developer to become an expert data architect?* This book reflects the
    work I do on a daily basis, to design, develop, and maintain scalable, robust,
    and cost-effective solutions for different data-engineering problems.

- en: Java architectural patterns and tools enable architects to develop reliable,
    scalable, and secure data engineering solutions to collect, manipulate, manage,
    and publish data. There are many books and online materials that discuss data
    architectures in general. There are other sets of books and online materials that
    focus on and dive deep into the technology stack. While such materials provide
    architects with essential knowledge, they often lack details on how an architect
    should approach a data engineering problem practically and create the best-suited
    architecture by using logical inference. In this book, I have tried to formalize
    a few techniques by which a data architect can approach a problem to create effective
    solutions.

- en: In this book, I will take you on a journey in which you learn the basics of
    data engineering and how to use the basics to analyze and propose solutions for
    a data engineering problem. I also discuss how a beginner architect can choose
    the correct technology stack to implement a solution. I also touch upon data security
    and governance for those solutions.

- en: One of the challenges that architects face is there is always more than one
    way to do things. We also discuss how to measure different architectural alternatives
    and how you can correctly choose the best-suited alternative using data-driven
    techniques.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '*Scalable Data Architecture* is written for Java developers, data engineers,
    and aspiring data architects who have at least some working knowledge of either
    backend systems or data engineering solutions. This book assumes that you have
    at least some working knowledge of Java and know the basic concepts of Java. This
    book will help you grow into a successful Java-based data architect.'

- en: Data architects and associate architects will find this book helpful to hone
    their skills and excel at their work. Non-Java backend developers or data engineers
    can also use the concepts of this book. However, it might be difficult for them
    to follow the code and implementation of the solutions.
