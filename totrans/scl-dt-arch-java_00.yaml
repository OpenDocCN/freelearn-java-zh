  zh: 前言
- en: When I started writing this book, I looked back at my experience in architecting
    and developing data engineering solutions, delivering and running those solutions
    effectively in production, and helping many companies to build and manage scalable
    and robust data pipelines and asked myself – *What are the most useful things
    that I can share to help an aspiring or beginner data architect, a data engineer,
    or a Java developer to become an expert data architect?* This book reflects the
    work I do on a daily basis, to design, develop, and maintain scalable, robust,
    and cost-effective solutions for different data-engineering problems.

  zh: 当我开始写这本书时，我回顾了自己在架构和开发数据工程解决方案、有效地交付和运行这些解决方案以及在许多公司构建和管理可扩展和健壮的数据管道方面的经验，并问自己——*我能分享哪些最有用的事情来帮助有志或初学的数据架构师、数据工程师或Java开发者成为数据架构师专家？*
    这本书反映了我在日常工作中所做的工作，即设计、开发和维护针对不同数据工程问题的可扩展、健壮和成本效益的解决方案。
- en: Java architectural patterns and tools enable architects to develop reliable,
    scalable, and secure data engineering solutions to collect, manipulate, manage,
    and publish data. There are many books and online materials that discuss data
    architectures in general. There are other sets of books and online materials that
    focus on and dive deep into the technology stack. While such materials provide
    architects with essential knowledge, they often lack details on how an architect
    should approach a data engineering problem practically and create the best-suited
    architecture by using logical inference. In this book, I have tried to formalize
    a few techniques by which a data architect can approach a problem to create effective
    solutions.

  zh: Java架构模式和工具使架构师能够开发可靠、可扩展和安全的工程解决方案，用于收集、处理、管理和发布数据。有许多书籍和在线资料讨论了数据架构的一般概念。还有其他一系列书籍和在线资料专注于并深入探讨了技术栈。虽然这些资料为架构师提供了必要知识，但它们通常缺乏关于架构师如何实际处理数据工程问题以及如何通过逻辑推理创建最适合的架构的细节。在这本书中，我尝试通过一些技术手段，使数据架构师能够以问题为导向，创建有效的解决方案。
- en: In this book, I will take you on a journey in which you learn the basics of
    data engineering and how to use the basics to analyze and propose solutions for
    a data engineering problem. I also discuss how a beginner architect can choose
    the correct technology stack to implement a solution. I also touch upon data security
    and governance for those solutions.

- en: One of the challenges that architects face is there is always more than one
    way to do things. We also discuss how to measure different architectural alternatives
    and how you can correctly choose the best-suited alternative using data-driven
    techniques.

  zh: 《可扩展数据架构》是为具有至少一些后端系统或数据工程解决方案工作知识的Java开发者、数据工程师和有志成为数据架构师的人编写的。本书假设您至少有一些Java的工作知识，并了解Java的基本概念。这本书将帮助您成长为一名成功的基于Java的数据架构师。
- en: Data architects and associate architects will find this book helpful to hone
    their skills and excel at their work. Non-Java backend developers or data engineers
    can also use the concepts of this book. However, it might be difficult for them
    to follow the code and implementation of the solutions.
