    specifications used to develop server-side enterprise Java applications. Most
    chapters in this book will cover a single Jakarta EE specification, such as **Contexts
    and Dependency Injection** (**CDI**), which is used to integrate different parts
    of an application, or Jakarta RESTful Web Services, which is used to develop RESTful
    web services. We also cover Jakarta EE APIs for processing data in JSON format,
    as well as Jakarta Faces, which is used to develop web-based user interfaces.
    We also delve into how to interact with relational databases, implementing two-way
    communication between clients and servers in web applications, security, and messaging.

- en: Jakarta EE is a collection of API specifications designed to work together when
    developing server-side enterprise Java applications. Jakarta EE is a standard
    for which there are multiple implementations. This fact prevents vendor lock-in
    since code developed against the Jakarta EE specification can be deployed in any
    Jakarta EE-compliant implementation.

- en: At its core, Jakarta EE is a specification, a piece of paper, if you will. Implementations
    of Jakarta EE specifications need to be developed so that application developers
    can actually develop server-side enterprise Java applications against the Jakarta
    EE standard.
  prefs: []

- en: Each Jakarta EE API can have multiple implementations. The popular Hibernate
    Object-Relational Mapping tool, for example, is an implementation of Jakarta Persistence,
    but it is by no means the only one. Other Jakarta Persistence implementations
    include EclipseLink and Open JPA. Similarly, there are multiple implementations
    of every single Jakarta EE specification.

- en: Jakarta EE applications are typically deployed to an application server. Some
    popular application servers include JBoss, Websphere, Weblogic, and GlassFish.
    Each application server is considered to be a Jakarta EE implementation. Application
    server vendors either develop their own implementations of the several Jakarta
    EE specifications or choose to include an existing implementation.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Application developers benefit from the Jakarta EE standard by not being tied
    to a specific Jakarta EE implementation. As long as an application is developed
    against the standard Jakarta EE APIs, it should be very portable across application
    server vendors.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Application server vendors then bundle a set of Jakarta EE API implementations
    together as part of their application server offerings. Since each implementation
    is compliant with the corresponding Jakarta EE specification, code developed against
    one implementation can run unmodified against any other implementation, avoiding
    a vendor lock-in.

- en: In 2017, Oracle donated **Java EE** to the Eclipse Foundation and as part of
    the process, Java EE was renamed Jakarta EE. The donation to the Eclipse Foundation
    meant that the Jakarta EE specification became truly vendor-neutral, with no single
    vendor having control over the specifications.

- en: Java EE, in turn, was introduced back in 2006 by Sun Microsystems. The first
    version of Java EE was Java EE 5\. Java EE replaced **J2EE**; the last version
    of J2EE was J2EE 1.4, released back in 2003\. Even though J2EE can be considered
    obsolete technology, having been superseded by Java EE several years ago and then
    renamed Jakarta EE, the term *J2EE* refuses to die. Many individuals to this day
    still refer to Jakarta EE as J2EE and many companies advertise on their websites
    and job boards that they are looking for “J2EE developers”, seemingly unaware
    that they are referring to a technology that has been obsolete for several years.
    The current correct term for the technology is Jakarta EE.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Additionally, the term J2EE has become a “catch-all” term for any server-side
    Java technology; frequently Spring applications are referred to as J2EE applications.
    **Spring** is not and never has been J2EE. As a matter of fact, Spring was created
    by Rod Johnson as an alternative to J2EE back in 2002\. Just as with Jakarta EE,
    Spring applications are frequently erroneously referred to as J2EE applications.
